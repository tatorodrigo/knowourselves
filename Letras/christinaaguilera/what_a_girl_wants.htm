        Like a rock you waited so patiently, while I got it together<br>
        While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched,<br>
        'Cause in my heart was a picture of us:<br>
        Holding hands, making plans,<br>

        A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith<br>
        Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together<br>
        While I figured it out, they say, "If you love something let it go<br>
        If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know<br>
        It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure"<br>
        And you're ready and willing to give me more [than]....<br>

        <br>
        Somebody sensitive and tough;<br>
        Somebody there when the going gets rough;<br>
        Every night, he'll be giving his love<br>
        To just one girl... one girl... one<br>
        Somebody cool but real tender too;<br>
        Somebody, baby, just like you<br>
        Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew<br>
        I'm thankin' you for being there for me<br>
