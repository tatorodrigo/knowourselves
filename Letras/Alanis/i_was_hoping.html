      <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
        we were talking outside it was cold<br>
        We were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter<br>
        My wife is in the next room we’ve been having troubles you know<br>
        Please don’t tell her or anyone but I need to talk to somebody<br>
        You said "wouldn’t it be a shame if I knew how great I was<br>
        Five minutes before I’d died I’d be filled with such regret<br>
        Before I took my last breath" and I said "you’re willing to tell me this 
        now<br>
        And you’re not going to die anytime soon"<br>
        And I said I haven’t been eating chicken or meat or anything and you said 
        yes<br>
        But you’ve been wearing leather<br>
        And laughed and said we’re at the top of the food chain<br>
        And yes you’re still a fine woman<br>
        And I cringed<br>
        <br>
        I was hoping I was hoping we could heal each other<br>
        I was hoping I was hoping we could be raw together<br>
        <br>
        We left the restaurant where the head waiter (in his 60’s) said<br>
        "Goodbye sir thankyou for your business sir you’re successful and established 
        sir<br>
        And we like the frequency with which you dine here sir<br>
        And your money"<br>
        And when I walked by they said "thank you too dear" I was all pigtails 
        and cords<br>
        And there was a day when I would’ve said something like<br>
        "Hey dude I could buy and sell this place so kiss it"<br>
        I too once thought I was owed something<br>
        <br>
        I was hoping I was hoping we could challenge each other<br>
        I was hoping I was hoping we could crack each other up<br>
        <br>
        I too thought that when proved wrong I lost somehow<br>
        I too once thought life was cruel<br>
        It’s a cycle really you think I’m withdrawing and guilt tripping you<br>
        I think you’re insensitive and I don’t feel heard and I said do you belive<br>
        We are fundamentally judgemental?<br>
        Fundamentally evil?<br>
        And you said yes I said I don’t believe in revenge<br>
        In right or worng good or bad you said<br>
        "Well what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency room bleeding 
        after beating<br>
        His kid and she threw a shoe at his head<br>
        I think what he did was wrong<br>
        And I would’ve had a hard time feeling compassion for him"<br>
        I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged<br>
        <br>
        I was hoping I was hoping we could dance together<br>
        I was hoping I was hoping we could be creamy together</font></div>
