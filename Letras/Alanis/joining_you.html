        dar, your mom, my friend, left a message on my machine<br>
        She was frantic saying you were talking crazy<br>
        That you wanted to do away with yourself I guess she thought I’d be a 
        perfect resort<br>
        Cause we’ve had this inexplicable connection<br>
        Since our youth and yes they’re in shock they are panicked you and your 
        chronic<br>
        Them and their drama you this embarrassment us in the middle of this delusion<br>
        <br>
        If we were our bodies<br>
        If we were our futures<br>
        If we were our defenses I'd be joining you<br>
        If we were our culture<br>
        If we were our leaders<br>
        If we were our denials I'd be joining you<br>
        <br>
        I remember vividly a day years ago we were camping<br>
        You knew more than you thought you should know<br>
        You said "I don’t ever want to be brainwashed"<br>
        And you were mindboggling you were intense<br>
        You were uncomfortable in your own skin<br>
        You were thirsty but mostly you were beautiful<br>
        <br>
        If we were our nametags<br>
        If we were our rejections<br>
        If we were our outcomes I'd be joining you<br>
        <br>
        If we were our indignities<br>
        If we were our successes<br>
        If we were our emotions I'd be joining you<br>
        <br>
        You and I we’re like 4 year olds<br>
        We want to know why and how come about everything<br>
        We want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds<br>
        And never talk small and be intuitive<br>
        And question mightily and find god my tortured beacon<br>
        We need to find like-minded companions<br>
        <br>
        If we were their condemnations<br>
        If we were their projections<br>
        If we were our paranois I'd be joining you<br>
        <br>
        If we were our incomes<br>
        If we were our obsessions<br>
        If we were our afflictions I'd be joining you<br>
        <br>
        We need reflection we need a really good memory<br>
        Feel free to call me a little more often</font></div>
