        want you to know that I’m happy for you<br>
        I wish nothing but the best for you both<br>
        An older version of me<br>
        Is she perverted like me<br>
        Would she go down on your in a theater<br>
        Does she speak eloquently<br>
        And would she have your baby<br>
        I’m sure she’d make a really excellent mother<br>
        <br>
        ‘Cause the love that you gave that we made<br>
        Wasn’t able to make it enough for you to be open wide (no)<br>
        And every time you speak her name<br>
        Does she know how you told me you’d hold me<br>
        Until you died, ‘til you died<br>
        But you’re still alive<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS:<br>
        And I’m here to remind you<br>
        Of the mess you left when you went away<br>
        It’s not fair to deny me<br>
        Of the cross I bear that you gave to me<br>
        You, you, you oughta know<br>
        <br>
        You seem very well, things look peaceful<br>
        I’m not quite as well, I thought you should know<br>
        Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity<br>
        I hate to but you in the middle of dinner<br>
        It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced<br>
        Are you thinking of me when you fuck her<br>
        <br>
        'Cause the love that you gave that we made<br>
        Wasn’t able to make it enough for you to be open wide (no)<br>
        And every time you speak her name<br>
        Does she know how you told me you’d hold me<br>
        Until you died, ‘til you died<br>
        But you’re sill alive<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        ‘Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me<br>
        And I’m not gonna fade<br>
        As soon as you close your eyes and you know it<br>
        And every time I scratch my nails down someone else’s back<br>
        I hope you feel it...well can you feel it<br>
        <br>
