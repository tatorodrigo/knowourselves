        you were self sufficient and needless<br>
        your house was fully decorated in that sense<br>
        <br>

        with me to a point<br>
        a case of careful what you wish for<br>
        but what you knew was enough to begin<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and so you called 
        and courted fiercely<br>
        so you rached out, entirely fearless<br>
        and yet you knew of reservation and how it serves<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and I salute 
        you for your courage<br>
        and I applaud your perseverance<br>
        and I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces<br>
        that I represent<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">so you were 
        in but not entirely<br>
        you were up for this but not totally<br>
        you knew how arms length-ing can maintain doubt<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and so you fell 
        and you're intact<br>
        so you dove in and you're still breathing<br>
        so you jumped and you're still flying if not shocked<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and I support 
        you in your trusting<br>
        and I commend you for your wisdom<br>
        and I'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces<br>
        that I represent<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">you found creative 
        ways to distance<br>
        you hid away from much through humor<br>
        your choice of armor was your intellect<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and so you felt 
        and you're still here<br>
        and so you died and you're still standing<br>
        and so you softened and you're still safely in command<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">self protection 
        was in times of true danger<br>
        your best defense to mistrust and be wary<br>
        surrendering a feat of unequalled measure<br>
        and I'm thrilled to let you in<br>
        overjoyed to be let in in kind</font></div>
