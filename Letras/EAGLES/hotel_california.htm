        a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
        Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air<br>
        Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light<br>
        My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
        I had to stop for the night<br>
        <br>
        There she stood in the doorway;<br>
        I heard the mission bell<br>
        And I was thinking to myself,<br>
        'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'<br>
        Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
        There were voices down the corridor,<br>
        I thought I heard them say...<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
        Such a lovely place<br>
        Such a lovely face<br>
        Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
        Any time of year, you can find it here<br>
        <br>
        Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends<br>
        She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends<br>
        How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.<br>
        Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
        <br>
        So I called up the Captain,<br>
        'Please bring me my wine'<br>
        He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'<br>
        And still those voices are calling from far away,<br>
        Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
        Just to hear them say...<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
        Such a lovely place<br>
        Such a lovely face<br>
        They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
        What a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
        <br>
        Mirrors on the ceiling,<br>
        The pink champagne on ice<br>
        And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'<br>
        And in the master's chambers,<br>
        They gathered for the feast<br>
        The stab it with their steely knives,<br>
        But they just can't kill the beast<br>
        <br>
        Last thing I remember, I was<br>
        Running for the door<br>
        I had to find the passage back<br>
        To the place I was before<br>
        'Relax,'said the night man,<br>
