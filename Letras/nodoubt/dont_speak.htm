        and me<br>
        We used to be together<br>
        Every day together always<br>
        <br>
        I really feel<br>
        That I'm losing my best friend<br>
        I can't believe<br>
        This could be the end<br>
        <br>
        It looks as though you're letting go<br>
        And if it's real,<br>
        Well I don't want to know<br>
        <br>
        Don't speak<br>
        I know just what you're saying<br>
        So please stop explaining<br>
        Don't tell me 'cause it hurts<br>
        Don't speak<br>
        I know what you're thinking<br>
        I don't need your reasons<br>
        Don't tell me 'cause it hurts<br>
        <br>
        Our memories<br>
        They can be inviting<br>
        But some are altogether<br>
        Mighty frightening<br>
        <br>
        As we die, both you and I<br>
        With my head in my hands<br>
        I sit and cry<br>
        <br>
        Don't speak<br>
        I know just what you're saying<br>
        So please stop explaining<br>
        Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no no no<br>
        Don't speak<br>
        I know what you're thinking<br>
        And I don't need your reasons<br>
        Don't tell me 'cause it hurts<br>
        <br>
        It's all ending,<br>
        I gotta stop pretending who we are...<br>
        <br>
        You and me<br>
        I can see us dying... are we?<br>
        <br>
        Don't speak<br>
        I know just what you're saying<br>
        So please stop explaining<br>
