        Your wildness scares me<br>
        So does your freedom<br>
        You say you can&#146;t stand the restrictions<br>
        I find myself trying to change you<br>
        If you were meant to be my lover I wouldn&#146;t have to<br>
        <br>
        And I feel so mean, I feel in between<br>
        &#145;Cause I&#146;m about to give you away<br>

        We keep repeating mistakes for souvenirs<br>
        And we&#146;ve been in between the days for years<br>
        And I know that when I see you I&#146;m going to die<br>
        I know I&#146;m going to want you and you know why<br>
        It&#146;s going to kill me to see you with the next girl<br>
        &#145;Cause I&#146;m the most gorgeously jealous kind of ex-girl<br>
