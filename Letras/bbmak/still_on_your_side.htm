        will stand up for you no matter what you are going through,<br>
        going through, going through<br>
        <br>
        You found a place where you belong<br>
        New friends that can do no wrong<br>
        That's what you believe<br>
        But who is going to be there when you fall<br>
        To build up when you are feeling small<br>
        Give you love that you need<br>
        Who will, I will<br>
        When the whole world turns against you,<br>
        Ain't no lie<br>
        <br>
        Don't you know that I will stand up for you<br>
        No matter what you are going through<br>
        I'm still on your side<br>
        Any time day or night<br>
        Don't care if it's wrong or right<br>
        I'm still on your side<br>
        <br>
        You want to run you want to break free<br>
        What you want ain't what you need<br>
        Can't you see that I care<br>
        I know I'm hard on you sometimes<br>
        But when you are looking for the things you can't find<br>
        Don't you know who'll be there<br>
        Who will, I will<br>
        When it's more than you can handle<br>
        Ain't no lie<br>
        <br>
        Don't you know that I will stand up for you<br>
        No matter what you are going through<br>
        I'm still on your side<br>
        Any time day or night<br>
        Don't care if it's wrong or right<br>
        I'm still on your side<br>
        <br>
        I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there<br>
        I'll be there when you need me<br>
        I won't let you go<br>
        There's nothing I won't do I'll be there<br>
        <br>
        Don't you know that I will stand up for you<br>
        No matter what you are going through<br>

        <br>
        I will be around when the others let you down<br>
        I'm still on your side<br>
        Anytime you need help and you can't find nobody else<br>
