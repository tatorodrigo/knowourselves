        I think she wants some water<br>
        To put out the blow torch<br>

        Let me clip Your dirty wings<br>
        Let me take a ride Don't hurt yourself<br>

        Maybe she would like more food<br>
        She asks me to untie her<br>
        A chase would be nice for a few<br>

        Polly says her back hurts<br>
        And she's just as bored as me<br>
        She caught me off my guard<br>
        It amazes me, the will of instinct<br>
