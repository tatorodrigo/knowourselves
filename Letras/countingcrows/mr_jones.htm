        was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl<br>
        Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer<br>
        She dances while his father plays guitar<br>
        She's suddenly beautiful<br>
        We all want something beautiful<br>
        I wish I was beautiful<br>
        So come dance this silence down through the morning<br>
        Cut up, Maria!<br>
        Show me some of them Spanish dances<br>
        Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones<br>
        Believe in me<br>
        Help me believe in anything<br>
        Cause I want to be someone who believes<br>
        Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales<br>
        Stare at the beautiful women<br>
        "She's looking at you. Ah no, no, she's looking at me."<br>
        Smiling in the bright lights<br>
        Coming through in stereo<br>
        When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely<br>
        I will paint my picture<br>
        Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray<br>
        All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful<br>
        Gray is my favorite color<br>
        I felt so symbolic, yesterday<br>
        If I knew Picasso<br>
        I would buy myself a gray guitar and play<br>
        Mr. Jones and me look into the future<br>
        Stare at the beautiful women<br>
        "She's looking at you. Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me."<br>
        Standing in the spotlight<br>
        I bought myself a gray guitar<br>
        When everybody loves me I will never be lonely<br>
        I will never be lonely<br>
        Said I never gonna be..lonely<br>
        I wanna to be a lion<br>
        Everybody wants to pass as cats<br>
        We all want to be big, big stars, but we got different reasons for that<br>
        Believe in me, because I don't believe in anything<br>
        And I want to be someone to believe, to believe<br>
        Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio<br>
        Yeah we stare at the beautiful women<br>
        "She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me."<br>
        I want to be Bob Dylan<br>
        Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky<br>
        When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be<br>
        Mr. Jones and me staring at the video<br>
        When I look at the television I want to see me staring right back at me<br>
        We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how<br>
        But when everybody loves me<br>
        I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be<br>
        Mr. Jones and me: we're gonna be big stars...</font></div>
