        You think you gotta keep me iced<br>
        You don't<br>
        You think I'm gonna spend your cash<br>
        I won't<br>
        Even if you were broke<br>
        My love don't cost a thing<br>
        Think I wanna drive your Benz<br>
        I don't<br>
        If I wanna floss I got my own<br>
        Even if you were broke<br>
        My love don't cost a thing<br>
        <br>
        When you rolled up in the Escalade<br>
        Saw that truck you gave to the valet<br>
        Knew that it was game when you looked at me<br>
        Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling<br>
        Saw you later in the corner booth<br>
        Raising up a toast so I would notice you<br>
        But your heart's a mess<br>
        Think you outta know<br>
        Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control<br>
        <br>
        All that matter's is<br>
        That you treat me right<br>
        Give me all the things I need<br>
        That money can't buy, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        When I took a chance<br>
        Thought you'd understand<br>
        Baby, credit cards aren't romance<br>
        So you're tryin' to buy what's already yours<br>
        What I need from you is not available in stores<br>
        Seen a side of you that I really feel<br>
        Doing way too much, never keep it real<br>
        If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road<br>
        Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?<br>
        I've got to go<br>
        <br>
        All that matter's is<br>
        That you treat me right<br>
        Give me all the things I need<br>
        That money can't buy, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        A thing, a thing, a thing<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        You think the money that you make<br>
        Can substitute the time you take<br>
        Take the keys here to my heart<br>
        Then you can win my heart and get what's in my heart<br>
        I think you need to take some time<br>
        To show me that your love is true<br>
        There's more than dollar signs in you<br>
        Then you can win my heart and get what's in my heart<br>
        <br>
