        dont know when we fell apart<br>
        The love that we had was like a work of art<br>
        I used to see heaven in your eyes<br>
        Now angels are falling from your skies<br>
        <br>
        The things we said, were so wrong<br>
        I havent held you for so long<br>
        My foolish pride, turns me inside<br>
        Why did we tell all thoes lies?<br>
        You can reach for the phone,<br>
        You dont have to be alone.<br>
        <br>
        Outside the winter seems so cold<br>
        Your heart is frozen like the snow<br>
        And there's no one home, to keep you safe and warm<br>
        Your eyes are red because you cry<br>
        You fell asleep by the fire side<br>
        But there's one thing you should know<br>
        On this christmas baby, you dont have to be alone<br>
        <br>
        I have only one wish on my list<br>
        For me you would be the perfect gift, oohh yeah, yeah<br>
        There's nothing colder than an empty home<br>
        And holidays were never meant to be alone<br>
        <br>
        The smiles we gave when our hearts were safe<br>
        By each others love and warmth<br>
        Thats subsided now, no happiness around <br>
        If I could only find a way to your heart<br>
        <br>
        Outside the winter seems so cold<br>
        Your heart is frozen like the snow<br>
        And there's no one home, to keep you safe and warm<br>
        Your eyes are red because you cry<br>
        You fell asleep by the fire side<br>
        But there's one thing you should know<br>
        On this christmas baby, you dont have to be alone<br>
        <br>
        You dont...have to be alone<br>
        You dont have to be...all alone at home<br>
        You dont...have...to be alone<br>
        You dont have to be alone<br>
        <br>
        Outside the winter seems so cold<br>
        Your heart is frozen like the snow<br>
