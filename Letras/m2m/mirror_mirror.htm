        <br>
        Why don't I like the girl I see<br>
        The one who's standing right in front of me<br>
        Why don't I think before I speak<br>
        I should have listened to that voice inside me<br>
        I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind<br>
        To say the kind of things I said last night<br>
        <br>
        Mirror mirror hanging on the wall<br>
        You don't have to tell me who's the biggest fool of all<br>
        Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me<br>
        And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me<br>
        <br>

        Mirror mirror lie to me<br>
        Show me what I wanna see<br>
        <br>
        Why did I let you walk away<br>
        When all I had to do was say I'm sorry<br>
        I let my pride get in the way<br>
        And in the heat of the moment I was to blame<br>
        I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind<br>
        Now in the cold light of the day I realize<br>
        <br>
        Mirror mirror hanging on the wall<br>
        You don't have to tell me who's the biggest fool of all<br>
        Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me<br>
        And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me<br>
        <br>
        If only wishes could be dreams<br>
        And know my dreams could come true<br>
        There would be two us standing here in front of you<br>
        If you could show me that someone that I used to be<br>
        Bring back my baby, my baby to me<br>
        <br>
