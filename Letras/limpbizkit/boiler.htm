        like I'm 'a do everything myself<br>

        I crawled up your butt from hell<br>

        You just leave it alone<br>
        And don't regret it<br>
        Sometimes some things turn into dumb things<br>
        And that's when you put your foot down<br>
        <br>
        Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you? (like you)<br>
        Why do you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (like me)<br>
        How could you do somebody like that<br>
        You know that I'm never coming back<br>

        Ladies, gentlement<br>
        What you are experiencing<br>
        Is in fact an inner lie man<br>
        I would like you to kick back<br>
        And think about everything you've just heard</font></div>
