        hands are lined with dirt from long days in the field<br>
        Mother's hands are serving meals in a caf&eacute; on Main Street<br>
        With mouths to feed... just tryin' to keep clothing on our backs<br>
        And all I hear about... is how it's so bad<br>
        It's too bad, it's stupid<br>
        Too late, so wrong, so long<br>
        It's too bad we had no time to rewind<br>
        Let's walk, let's talk<br>
        <br>
        You left without saying goodbye, although I'm sure you tried<br>
        You call the house from time to time to make sure we're alive<br>
        But you weren't there right when I needed you the most<br>
        And now I dream about it... and how it's so bad<br>
        <br>
        It's too bad, it's stupid<br>
        Too late, so wrong, so long<br>
        It's too bad we had no time to rewind<br>
        Let's walk, let's talk<br>

        It's so bad, it's too bad, it's stupid<br>

        It's too bad we had no time to rewind<br>
        Let's walk, let's talk<br>
        <br>
        Father's hands are lined with guilt from tearing us apart<br>
        Guess it turned out in the end, just look at where we are<br>
        We made it out...<br>
        ...we still got clothing on our backs<br>
        And now I scream about it...<br>
        ...and how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad<br>
        <br>
        It's too bad, it's stupid<br>
        Too late, so wrong, so long<br>
