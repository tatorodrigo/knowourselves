        I'm lyin' in my bed at nite<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        Nothing ever seems to turn out right<br>
        And I don't wanna grow up<br>
        <br>
        How do you move in a world of fog that's always changing things<br>
        Makes the wish that I could be a dog<br>
        <br>
        When I see the price that you pay<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        I don't ever wanna be that way<br>
        And I don't wanna grow up<br>
        <br>
        Seems that folks turn into things that they never want<br>
        The only thing to live for is today...<br>
        <br>
        I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        Open up the medicine chest<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna have to shout it out<br>
        I don't want my hair to fall out<br>
        I don't wanna be filled with doubt<br>
        I don't wanna be a good boy scout<br>
        I don't wanna have to learn to count<br>
        I don't want the biggest amount<br>
        No I don't wanna grow up<br>
        <br>
        Well when I see my parents fight<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        They all go out and drinkin' all night<br>
        And I don't wanna grow up<br>
        <br>
        I'd rather stay here in my room<br>
        Nothin' out there but sad and gloom<br>
        I don't wanna live in a big old tomb on grand street<br>
        <br>
        When I see the 5 o'clock news<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        Comb their hair and shine their shoes<br>
        I don't wanna grow up<br>
        <br>
        Stay around in my old hometown<br>
        I don't wanna put no money down<br>
        I don't wanna get me a big old loan<br>
        Work them fingers to the bone<br>
        I don't wanna float on a broom<br>
        Fall in love, get married then boom<br>
        How the hell did I get here so soon<br>
        <br>
        No I don't want to grow up</font></div>
