        Any other day i would call<br>
        you would say<br>
        "baby how's your day?"<br>
        but today it aint the same<br>
        every other word is<br>
        Uh Huh, Yea Okay,<br>
        could it be that you,<br>
        are at the crib with anotha lady?<br>
        If you took it there first if all<br>
        let me say, i am not the one<br>
        to sit around and be played<br>
        so prove your self to me,<br>
        or the girl that you claim<br>
        why don't you say the thangs<br>
        that you said to me yesterday?<br>
        <br>
        (Bridge)<br>
        I know you say that i am assuming things<br>
        Something's going down thats the way it seems<br>
        Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange<br>
        If nobody's holding you back from me<br>
        Cause I know how you useually do<br>
        When you say everything to me times two<br>
        Why can't you just tell the truth?<br>
        If somebody's there then tell me who<br>
        <br>
        (Chorus)<br>
        <br>
        (Verse2)<br>
        What is up with this?<br>
        Tell the truth,<br>
        who you with?<br>
        How would you like it if<br>
        I came over with my clique<br>
        Don't try to change it now<br>
        See you gotta bounce<br>
        When two seconds ago<br>
        you said you just got in the house.<br>
        It's hard to believe that you,<br>
        are at home, by yourself<br>
        when i just heard the voice<br>
        heard the voice of someone else.<br>
        Just this question<br>
        Why do you feel you gotta lie?<br>
        Gettin caught up in your game<br>
        when you can not say my name<br>
        <br>
        (bridge)<br>
