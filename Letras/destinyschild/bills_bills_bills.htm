        first we started out real cool<br>
        Taking me places I ain't never been<br>
        But now, you're getting comfortable<br>
        Ain't doing those things you did no more<br>
        You're slowly making me pay for things your money should be handling<br>
        And now you ask to use my car<br>
        Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank<br>
        And you have the audacity to even come and step to me<br>
        Ask to hold some money from me until you get your check next week<br>
        <br>
        (Bridge):<br>
        You trifling, good for nothing type of brother.<br>
        Oh Silly me, why haven't I found another<br>
        A baller, when times get hard he's the one to help me out<br>
        Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about<br>
        <br>
        (Chorus):<br>
        Can you pay my bills<br>
        Can you pay my telephone bills<br>
        Can you pay my automo-bills<br>
        If you did then maybe we could chill<br>
        I don't think you do<br>
        So, you and me are through<br>
        <br>
        (Repeat)<br>
        <br>
        Now you've been maxing out my card<br>
        Givin' me bad credit, buyin' gifts with my own name<br>
        Haven't paid the first bill<br>
        But you're steady heading to the mall<br>
        Goin' on shopping sprees<br>
        Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'<br>
        <br>
        And then you use my cell phone<br>
        Calling whoever that you think at home<br>
        And then when the bill comes all of a sudden you be acting dumb<br>
        Don't know where none of these calls come from<br>
        When your momma's number's here more than once<br>
        <br>
        (Bridge):<br>
        You trifling, good for nothing type of brother.<br>
        Oh Silly me, why haven't I found another<br>
        A baller, when times get hard he's the one to help me out<br>
        Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about<br>

        Can you pay my automo-bills<br>
        If you did then maybe we could chill<br>

        So, you and me are through<br>
