        Given her an extra key<br>
        All this time she was standing there<br>

        To be a true player ya haffa know how fi play<br>
        If she stay all night, convince her stay all day<br>
        Never admit to a word when she say<br>
        And she claim how you tell her baby, no way<br>
        <br>
        But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)<br>
        Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)<br>
        I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)<br>
        She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)<br>
        She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)<br>
        Here's the words that I told her (Wasn't me)<br>
        As the screams get louder (Wasn't me)<br>
        She stayed until it was over<br>

        Wanna tell you that I'm sorry<br>
        For the pain that I've caused<br>
        I've been listening to your reason<br>
        It makes no sense at all<br>
        People tell her that I'm sorry<br>
        For the pain that I've caused<br>
        You may think that you're a player<br>
