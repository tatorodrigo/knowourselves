      <div align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        can remember<br>
        The very first time I cried<br>
        How I wiped my eyes<br>
        And buried the pain inside<br>
        All of my memories<br>
        Good and bad that's passed<br>
        Didn't even take the time to realize<br>
        Staring at the cracks in the walls<br>
        'Cause I'm waiting for it all to come to an end<br>
        Still I curl up right under the bed<br>
        'Cause it's takin' over my head<br>
        All over again<br>
        <br>
        Do you even know who you are?<br>
        I guess I'm trying to find<br>
        A borrowed dream or a superstar?<br>
        I want to be a star<br>
        Is life good to you, or is it bad?<br>
        I can't tell anymore<br>
        Do you even know what you have?<br>
        <br>
        Lying awake<br>
        Watching the sunlight<br>
        How the birds will sing<br>
        As I count the rings around my eyes<br>
        Constantly pushing<br>
        The world I know aside<br>
        I don't even feel the pain<br>
        I don't even want to try<br>
        I'm looking for a way to become<br>
        The person I dreamt up<br>
        When I was 16<br>
        Oh, nothing is ever enough<br>
        Ooh, baby it ain't enough<br>
        Or what it may seem<br>
        <br>
        Do you even know who you are?<br>
        I'm still trying to find<br>
        A borrowed dream or a superstar?<br>
        Everybody wants to be<br>
        Is life good to you, or is it bad?<br>
        I can't tell anymore<br>
        Do you even know what you have?<br>
        No<br>
        <br>
        Sorry girl<br>
        Tell a tale for me<br>
        'Cause I'm wondering<br>
        How you really feel<br>
        <br>
        I'm a lonely girl<br>
        I'll tell a tale for you<br>
        'Cause I'm just trying to make<br>
        All my dreams come true<br>
        <br>
        Do you even know who you are?<br>
        Oh yeah, yeah<br>
        A borrowed dream or a superstar?<br>
        Oh, I wanted to be a star<br>
        Is life good to you, or is it bad?<br>
        I can't tell, I can't tell anymore<br>
        Do you even know what you have?<br>
        I guess not, I guess not<br>
        <br>
        Do you even know who you are?<br>
        I'm trying to find<br>
        A rising dream, or a falling star?<br>
        Oh, I have all these dreams<br>
        Is life good to you or is it bad?<br>
        I can't tell anymore<br>
        Do you even know what you have?<br>
        Oh, no, no</font></div>
