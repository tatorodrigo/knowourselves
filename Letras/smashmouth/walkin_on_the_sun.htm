          ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke<br>
          and teach the world to sing in perfect harmony<br>
          and teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars<br>
          hey i know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe<br>
          this is a love attack i know it went out but it's back<br>
          it's just like any fad it retracts before impact<br>
          and just like fashion it's a passion for the with it and hip<br>
          if you got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique<br>
          <br>
          CHORUS:<br>
          So don't delay, act now supplies are running out<br>
          Allow, if your still alive, six to eight years to arrive<br>
          and if you follow there may be a tomorrow but if<br>
          the offer's shun, you might as well be walkin' on the sun<br>
          <br>
          Twenty five years ago they spoke out and they broke out<br>
          of recession and opression and together they toked<br>
          and they folked out with guitars around a bonfire<br>
          just singin' and clapin' man what the hell happened<br>
          some were spell bound some were hell bound<br>
          some they fell down and some got back up and<br>
          fought against the melt down<br>
          and their kids are hippie chicks all hypocrites<br>
          because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it<br>
          <br>
          CHORUS:<br>
          <br>
          It ain't no joke when mamma's hankercheif is soaked<br>
          with the tears because her baby's life has been revoked<br>
          the bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the closeup<br>
          Mr. Wizard can't perform no GOD like hocus pocus<br>
          so don't sit back kick back and watch the world get bushwacked<br>
          news at 10:00 your neighborhood is under attack<br>
          put away the crack before the crack puts you away<br>
          you need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate<br>
          <br>
