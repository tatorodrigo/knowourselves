        ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
        I'm useless,but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
        I'm useless, but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        It's coming on<br>
        It's coming on<br>
        It's coming on<br>
        <br>
        Yeah... Ha Ha!<br>
        Finally someone let me out of my cage<br>
        Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age<br>
        Nah I couldn't be there<br>
        Nah you shouldn't be scared<br>
        I'm good at repairs<br>
        And I'm under each snare<br>
        Intangible<br>
        Bet you didn't think so I command you to<br>
        Panoramic view<br>
        Look I'll make it all manageable<br>
        Pick and choose<br>
        Sit and lose<br>
        All you different crews<br>
        Chicks and dudes<br>
        Who you think is really kickin' tunes?<br>
        Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube<br>
        Like you lit the fuse<br>
        You think it's fictional<br>
        Mystical? Maybe<br>
        Spiritual<br>
        Hearable<br>
        What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy<br>
        Lifeless<br>
        To know the definition for what life is<br>
        Priceless<br>
        For you because I put you on the hype shit<br>
        You like it?<br>
        Gunsmokin' righteous with one token<br>
        Psychic among those<br>
        Possess you with one go<br>
        <br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
        I'm useless,but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>

        The future is coming on<br>
        It's coming on<br>
        It's coming on<br>
        It's coming on<br>
        <br>
        The essence the basics<br>
        Without it you make it<br>
        Allow me to make this<br>
        Child, like in nature<br>
        Rhythm<br>
        You have it or you don't that's a fallacy<br>
        I'm in them<br>
        Every sprouting tree<br>
        Every child apiece<br>
        Every cloud and sea<br>
        You see with your eyes<br>
        I see destruction and demise<br>
        Corruption in disguise<br>
        From this fuckin' enterprise<br>
        Now I'm sucking to your lies<br>
        Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides<br>
        with me as a guide<br>
        But y'all can't see me now cos you don't see with your eye<br>
        You perceive with your mind<br>
        That's the inner<br>
        So I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor<br>
        Bust a few rhymes so mother fuckers<br>
        Remember where the thought is<br>
        I brought all this<br>
        So you can survive when law is lawless<br>
        Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead<br>
        No squealing, remember<br>
        (that it's all in your head)<br>
        <br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
        I'm useless, but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
        I'm useless, but not for long<br>
        My future is coming on<br>
