        I wanna get down lower than Atlantis<br>
        Going toe to toe with an enchantress<br>
        Get funky we've been funkadelic wearin' Pampers<br>
        While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers<br>
        Sharing transcripts while we over here<br>
        Dipping and dancin'<br>
        Rhythm romancin'<br>
        Wallflowers<br>
        Giving no action no<br>
        All hours we chillin' and max the flow\<br>
        Relaxing<br>
        Opposites attracting<br>
        I'ma toss my hat in<br>
        Floss when the track spin<br>
        Like I'm on a crack bend<br>
        Jigging and wiggling<br>
        Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent<br>
        No religion just bump the feed on<br>
        You'll feel reborn<br>
        Negativity we just dead it like decoy<br>
        Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on<br>
        The pulse when it respawns<br>
