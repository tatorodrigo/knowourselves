        know I don't know what it is<br>
        But something about you is so irresistible<br>
        <br>
        Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type<br>
        To hide what I feel inside<br>
        When he makes me weak with desire<br>
        I know that I'm supposed to make him wait<br>
        Let him think I like the chase But I can't stop fanning the fire<br>
        I Know I meant to say no<br>
        <br>
        But he's irresistible<br>
        Up close and personal<br>
        Now inescapable<br>
        I can hardly breathe<br>
        More than just physical<br>
        Deeper than spritual<br>
        His ways are powerful<br>
        And irresistible to me<br>
        (Yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)<br>
        <br>
        Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right<br>
        That I should really say goodnight<br>
        But I can't stop myself from falling<br>
        Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same<br>
        That I don't want to play no game<br>
        'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me<br>
        I know I meant to say no<br>
        (I meant to say no)<br>
        <br>
        But he's irresistible (irresistible)<br>
        Now inescapable<br>
        I can hardly breathe<br>
        (I can hardly breathe)<br>
        More than just physical<br>
        Deeper than spritual<br>
        His ways are powerful<br>
        Irresistible to me<br>
        <br>
        Can't you see whenever he's close to me<br>
        I really find it hard to breathe<br>

        Baby you know it's more than just spiritual<br>
        His kisses are powerful<br>
