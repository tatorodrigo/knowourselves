          heart is a bloom<br>
          Shoots up through the stony ground<br>
          There's no room<br>
          No space to rent in this town<br>
          <br>
          You're out of luck<br>
          And the reason that you had to care<br>
          The traffic is stuck<br>
          And you're not moving anywhere<br>
          <br>
          You thought you'd found a friend<br>
          To take you out of this place<br>
          Someone you could lend a hand<br>
          In return for grace<br>
          <br>
          It's a beautiful day<br>
          Sky falls, you feel like<br>
          It's a beautiful day<br>
          Don't let it get away<br>
          <br>
          You're on the road<br>
          But you've got no destination<br>
          You're in the mud<br>
          In the maze of her imagination<br>
          <br>
          You love this town<br>
          Even if that doesn't ring true<br>
          You've been all over<br>
          And it's been all over you<br>
          <br>
          It's a beautiful day<br>
          Don't let it get away<br>
          It's a beautiful day<br>
          <br>
          Touch me<br>
          Take me to that other place<br>
          Teach me<br>
          I know I'm not a hopeless case<br>
          <br>
          See the world in green and blue<br>
          See China right in front of you<br>
          See the canyons broken by cloud<br>
          See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out<br>
          See the Bedouin fires at night<br>
          See the oil fields at first light<br>
          And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth<br>
          After the flood all the colors came out<br>
          <br>
          It was a beautiful day<br>
          Don't let it get away<br>
          Beautiful day<br>
          <br>
          Touch me<br>
          Take me to that other place<br>
          Reach me<br>
          I know I'm not a hopeless case<br>
          <br>
          What you don't have you don't need it now<br>
          What you don't know you can feel it somehow<br>
          What you don't have you don't need it now<br>
          Don't need it now<br>
          Was a beautiful day</font></div>
