          not afraid<br>
          Of anything in this world<br>
          There's nothing you can throw at me<br>
          That I haven't already heard<br>
          <br>
          I'm just trying to find<br>
          A decent melody<br>
          A song that I can sing<br>
          In my own company<br>
          <br>
          I never thought you were a fool<br>
          But darling look at you<br>
          You gotta stand up straight<br>
          Carry your own weight<br>
          These tears are going nowhere baby<br>
          <br>
          You've got to get yourself together<br>
          You've got stuck in a moment<br>
          And now you can't get out of it<br>
          <br>
          Don't say that later will be better<br>
          Now you're stuck in a moment<br>
          And you can't get out of it<br>
          <br>
          I will not forsake<br>
          The colors that you bring<br>
          The nights you filled with fireworks<br>
          They left you with nothing<br>
          <br>
          I am still enchanted<br>
          By the light you brought to me<br>
          I listen through your ears<br>
          Through your eyes I can see<br>
          <br>
          And you are such a fool<br>
          To worry like you do<br>
          I know it's tough<br>
          And you can never get enough<br>
          Of what you don't really need now<br>
          My, oh my<br>
          <br>
          You've got to get yourself together<br>
          You've got stuck in a moment<br>
          And you can't get out of it<br>
          <br>
          Oh love, look at you now<br>
          You've got yourself stuck in a moment<br>
          And you can't get out of it<br>
          <br>
          I was unconscious, half asleep<br>
          The water is warm 'til you discover how deep<br>
          <br>
          I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall<br>
          It's a long way down to nothing at all<br>
          <br>
          You've got to get yourself together<br>
          You've got stuck in a moment<br>
          And you can't get out of it<br>
          <br>
          Don't say that later will be better<br>
          Now you're stuck in a moment<br>
          And you can't get out of it<br>
          <br>
          And if the night runs over<br>
          And if the day won't last<br>
          And if our way should falter<br>
          Along the stony pass<br>
          <br>
          And if the night runs over<br>
          And if the day won't last<br>
          And if your way should falter<br>
          Along this stony pass<br>
          <br>
          It's just a moment<br>
          This time will pass</font></div>
