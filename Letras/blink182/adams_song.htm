        never thought I'd die alone<br>
        I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?<br>
        I traced the cord back to the wall<br>
        No wonder it was never plugged in at all<br>
        I took my time, I hurried up<br>
        The choice was mine, I didn't think enough<br>
        I'm too depresed to go on, you'll be sorry when I'm gone<br>
        <br>
        I never conqured, rarely came<br>
        16 just held such better days<br>
        Days when I still felt alive<br>
        We couldn't wait to get outside<br>
        The world was watching<br>
        Hate to try<br>
        The tour was over we'd surivied<br>
        I couldn't wait till I got home<br>
        To pass the time in my room alone<br>
        <br>
        I never thought I'd die alone<br>
        Another six months, I'll be unknown<br>
        Give all my things to all my friends<br>
        You'll never step foot in my room again<br>
        You'll close it off, board it up<br>
        Remember the time that I spilled the cup<br>
        Of apple juice in the hall<br>
        Please tell mom this is not her fault<br>
        <br>
        I never conqured, rarely came<br>
        16 just held such better days<br>
        Days when I still felt alive<br>
        We couldn't wait to get outside<br>
        The world was watching<br>
        Hate to try<br>
        The tour was over we'd surivied<br>
        I couldn't wait till I got home<br>
        To pass the time in my room alone<br>
        <br>
        I never conqured, rarely came<br>
        Tomorrow holds such better days<br>
        Days when I can still feel alive<br>
        When I can't wait to get outside<br>
        The world is watching<br>
        The time goes by<br>
        The tour is over I'd surivied<br>
        I can't wait till I get home<br>
        To pass the time in my room alone</font></div>
