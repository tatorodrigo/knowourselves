        Come my lady<br>
        Come, come my lady<br>
        You're my butterfly<br>
        Sugar baby<br>
        Come my lady<br>
        Come, come my lady<br>
        You're my butterfly<br>
        Sugar baby<br>
        <br>
        Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing<br>
        Fierce nipple pierce<br>
        You got me sprung with your tongue ring<br>
        And I ain't gonna lie cause your loving gets me high<br>
        So to keep you by my side<br>
        There's nothing that I won't try<br>
        Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill<br>
        Time is passing<br>
        I'm asking, could this be real<br>
        'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still<br>
        The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal<br>
        I can feel too much is never enough<br>
        You're always there to lift me up<br>
        When these times get rough<br>
        I was lost, now I'm found<br>
        Ever since you've been around<br>
        You're the women that I want<br>
        So yo, I'm putting it down<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        I don't deserve you<br>
        Unless it's some kind of hidden message<br>
        To show me life is precious<br>
        Then I guess it's true<br>
        To tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you<br>
        I was lost and confused<br>
        Twisted and used up<br>
        Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it<br>
        My lifestyle's wild<br>
        I was living like a wild child<br>
        Trapped on a short leash<br>
        Paroled the police files<br>
        And yo, what' s happening now?<br>
        I see the sun breaking<br>
        Shining through dark clouds<br>
        And a vision of you standing out in a crowd<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me<br>
        The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me<br>
        So whatever tickles your fancy<br>
        Girl, it's you like Sid and Nancy<br>
        So sexy, almost evil<br>
        Talkin' about butterflies in my head<br>
        I used to think happy endings were only in the books I read<br>
        But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead<br>
        You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase<br>
        And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this<br>
        So butterfly, here is a song<br>
        And it's sealed with a kiss and a thank you miss<br>
        <br>
