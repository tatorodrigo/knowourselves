        all those times you stood by me<br>
        For all the truth that you made me see<br>
        For all the joy you brought to my life<br>
        For all the wrong that you made right<br>
        For every dream you made come true<br>
        For all the love I found in you<br>
        I'll be forever thankful baby<br>
        You're the one who held me up<br>
        Never let me fall<br>
        You're the one who saw me through through it all<br>
        <br>
        You were my strength when I was weak<br>
        You were my voice when I couldn't speak<br>
        You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
        You saw the best there was in me<br>
        Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
        You gave me faith 'coz you believed<br>
        I'm everything I am<br>
        Because you loved me<br>
        <br>
        You gave me wings and made me fly<br>
        You touched my hand I could touch the sky<br>
        I lost my faith, you gave it back to me<br>
        You said no star was out of reach<br>
        You stood by me and I stood tall<br>
        I had your love I had it all<br>
        I'm grateful for each day you gave me<br>
        Maybe I don't know that much<br>
        But I know this much is true<br>
        I was blessed because I was loved by you<br>
        <br>
        You were my strength when I was weak<br>
        You were my voice when I couldn't speak<br>
        You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
        You saw the best there was in me<br>
        Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
        You gave me faith 'coz you believed<br>
        I'm everything I am<br>
        Because you loved me<br>
        <br>
        You were always there for me<br>
        The tender wind that carried me<br>
        A light in the dark shining your love into my life<br>
        You've been my inspiration<br>
        Through the lies you were the truth<br>
        My world is a better place because of you<br>
        <br>
        You were my strength when I was weak<br>
        You were my voice when I couldn't speak<br>
        You were my eyes when I couldn't see<br>
        You saw the best there was in me<br>
        Lifted me up when I couldn't reach<br>
