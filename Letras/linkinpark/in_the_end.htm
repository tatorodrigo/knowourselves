        one thing/I don't know why<br>
        It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
        keep that in mind/I designed this rhyme<br>
        to explain in due time<br>
        All I knoe<br>
        Time is a valuable thing<br>
        Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
        Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
        The clock ticks life away<br>
        Its so unreal<br>
        Didn't look out below<br>
        Watch the time go right out the window<br>
        Trying to hold on/But didn't even know<br>
        Wasted it all just to<br>
        Watch it go<br>
        I kept everything inside and even tho I tried/It all fell apart<br>
        What it meant to me will evetually/be a memory/of a time when<br>
        <br>
        I tried so hard<br>
        And got so far<br>

        One thing/i don't know why<br>
        Doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
        Keep that in mind/I designed this rhyme<br>
        To remind myself How<br>
        I tried so hard<br>
        In spite of the way you were mocking me<br>
        Actin like I was a part of ur property<br>
        Remembering all the times you fought w/ me/I'm surprised<br>
        It got so (far)<br>
        Things aren't the way they were before<br>
        You wouln't even reconize me anymore<br>
        Not that you knew me back then<br>
        But it all comes bak to me<br>
        In the end<br>
        You kept evetyhing inside and even though I tried/it all fell apart<br>
        What it meant to me/will eventually/be a memory/of a time when I<br>
        <br>
        Tried so hard<br>
        And got so far<br>

        <br>
        Repeat 2x:<br>
        I put my trust in you<br>
        Pushed as far as i can go<br>
        For all this<br>
        Theres only one thing u should know<br>
        <br>
        I tried so hard<br>
