          makes this world go round<br>
          Will the answer let her down<br>
          She is so sweet and young<br>
          And her life has just begun<br>
          What does her future hold that's the story left unknown<br>
          Will she make it through her days, let our love lead the way<br>
          Part of me laughs (ooooh)<br>
          Part of me cries<br>
          Part of me wants to question why (question why)<br>
          What good is their joy<br>
          And why is there pain (ooh)<br>
          <br>
          No matter what we must go on<br>
          Just keep the faith<br>
          And let love lead the way<br>
          Everthing will work out fine<br>
          If you let love... love lead the way<br>
          Sitting there all alone<br>
          In the window of her room<br>
          Watching the world go by<br>
          Brings tears to her eyes<br>
          All she sees is hurt and pain, she wants to break the chain<br>
          She'll keep pressing everyday and she'll find her own sweet way<br>
          Part of me laughs (..me laughs)<br>
          Part of me cries (I cry)<br>
          Part of me wants to question why (wants to question why)<br>
          <br>
          One day you're here (you're here)<br>
          Next youne are go (you're gone)<br>
          No matter what we must go on (I will go on)<br>
          Just keep the faith (keep your faith)<br>
          And let love lead the way (I know, I know, I know, ooh whoa..)<br>
          You can be all that and still can be who you are<br>
          You gotta know for sure that it isn't make believe<br>
          You may feel weak but you are strong<br>
          Don't you give up if...<br>
          If you keep holding on, you'll never be wrong<br>
          Just close your eyes cause it lies deep in your heart, yeah<br>
