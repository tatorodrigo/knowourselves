        That's why I ain't got no time.<br>
        For these games and stupid tricks<br>
        Or these bitches on my dick.<br>
        That's how dudes be getting sick<br>
        That's how dicks be getting drips.<br>
        Falling victims to this shit<br>
        From these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs<br>
        That's why I ain't got no time...<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 1 (Obie 
        Trice)<br>
        Yo, I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk.<br>
        I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights Tunk pussy residue was on 
        my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you shoulda seen this 
        big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french roll stylin', body like a stallion<br>
        Sizin up the figure while my shit's getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck 
        or do I want to be her nigga<br>
        Caressin'this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits, sippin' on that 
        fine shit I ain't used to buyin'<br>
        I gotta hit it from behind, its mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but 
        that's another story<br>
        For surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like Bishop 
        in Juice<br>
        The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter 
        than the hottest block<br>
        Don't Stop!<br>
        The response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin', kinky 
        finger lickin' and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans.<br>
        I gotta slow down before I cum soon and work that nigga like a slave owner.<br>
        When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her<br>
        She foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' 
        like some sour cream dip without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, 
        pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks<br>
        We in the final stretch, the last part of sex.<br>
        I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next like what the fuck is goin' 
        on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and all, just picked up and vacated<br>
        Now I'm frusturated cuz my dick was unprotected, and Doctor Wesley tellin 
        me I really got that shit<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2 (Eminem)<br>
        Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone 
        better get this bitch, before she gets kicked in the stomach and she's 
        pregnant, buts she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her off the steps 
        of this porch my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to any 
        violence of any sort.<br>
        But what's she shovin' me for?<br>
        Doesn't she love me no more?<br>
        Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?<br>
        Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore.<br>
        What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?<br>
        She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours, and you find out 
        it isn't cus this bitch has been visitin' someone else and suckin' his 
        dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to Michigan, now the 
        plot is thickenin' worse cus you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' 
        dick in a hearse so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever 
        since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick so you go 
        to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then the doctor comes 
        out lookin' like Dennis the Menace and it's obvious to everyone in the 
        lobby it's AIDS, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it 
        so you jet back home, cus you gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you 
        gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo cus you love her, you never would 
        expect that blow,<br>
        Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?<br>
        Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me 
        home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis she's so deceivin', shit this
