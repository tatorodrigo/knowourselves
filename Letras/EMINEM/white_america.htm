        America!<br>
        We love you! How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful 
        country of ours?<br>
        The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect<br>
        The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
        the United States government has sworn to uphold.<br>
        (Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're 
        told...<br>
        <br>
        Verse 1<br>
        I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, so many motherfuckin' 
        people who feel like me<br>
        who share the same views and the same exact beliefs, it's like a fuckin' 
        army marchin' in back of me<br>
        So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed in no particular direction, 
        just sprays and sprays and straight through your radio waves it plays 
        and plays, till it stays stuck in your head for days and days<br>
        who woulda thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some 
        peroxide, reachin for a t-shirt to wear<br>
        that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?<br>
        How could I predict my words would have an impact like this<br>
        I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office, cuz Congress 
        keeps telling me I ain't causin' nuthin' but problems<br>
        and now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' 
        it, I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on...<br>
        <br>
        Chorus X2<br>
        White America!<br>
        I could be one of your kids<br>
        White America!<br>
        Little Eric looks just like this<br>
        White America!<br>
        Erica loves my shit<br>
        I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get<br>
        <br>
        Verse 2<br>
        Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself, if they were brown 
        Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf but Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's 
        dimples would help, make ladies swoon baby, ooh baby!<br>
        Look at my sales<br>
        Lets do the math, If I was black I would've sold half, I ain't have to 
        graduate from Lincoln High School to know that but I could rap, so fuck 
        school, I'm too cool to go back, gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' 
        studio's at<br>
        When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white, no labels wanted 
        to sign me almost gave up, I was like<br>
        Fuck it, until I met Dre, the only one to look past, gave me a chance, 
        and I lit a fire up under his ass helped him get back to the top, every 
        fan black that I got was probably his in exchange for every white fan 
        that he's got<br>
        Like damn, we just swapped.<br>
        Sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow, I'm like my skin is it starting to 
        work to my benefit now?<br>
        <br>
        Chorus X2<br>
        <br>
        Verse 3<br>
        See the problem is I speak to suburban kids who otherwise would of never 
        knew these words exist whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts 
        of piss, till I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence straight out 
        the tube, right into your living room I came, and kids flipped when they 
        knew I was produced by Dre<br>
        That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in, and they 
        connected with me too because I looked like them that's why they put my 
        lyrics up under this microscope, searchin' with a fine tooth comb, its 
        like this rope waitin' to choke, tightening around my throat, watching 
        me while I write this, like I don't like this (Nope)<br>
        All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working 
        round the clock, to try to stop my concerts early surely hip hop was never 
        a problem in Harlem only in Boston, after it bothered the fathers of daughters 
        starting to blossom so now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists 
        when they raggin', actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch, 
        or say faggot shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the posterchild, 
        the mother fuckin' spokesman now for...<br>
        <br>
        Chorus X2<br>
        <br>
        Verse 4<br>
        So to the parents of America<br>
        I am the derringer aimed at little Erica, to attack her character<br>
        The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns<br>
        Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress<br>
        And piss on the lawns of the White House and replace it with a Parental 
        Advisory sticker<br>
        To spit liquor in the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy<br>
        Fuck you Ms. Cheney!<br>
        Fuck you Tipper Gore!<br>
        Fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarassment 
        will allow me to have, Fuck you!<br>
        I'm just kiddin' America, you know I love you...</font></div>
