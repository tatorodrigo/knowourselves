        When I just a little baby boy,<br>
        my momma used to tell me these crazy things<br>
        She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,<br>
        she used to tell me he hated me<br>
        But then I got a little bit older<br>
        and I realized, she was the crazy one<br>
        But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change it<br>
        cause that's just the way she was<br>
        <br>
        They said I can't rap about bein broke no more<br>
        They say I can't rap about coke no more<br>
        (AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore<br>
        til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!<br>
        (AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinkin I'm playin<br>
        Thinkin I'm sayin the shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin it<br>
        (AHHH!) Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you<br>
        I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you<br>
        (AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causin too much chaos<br>
        Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?<br>
        "Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,<br>
        snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"<br>
        You god damn right BITCH, and now it's too late<br>
        I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states<br>
        I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches<br>
        vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, VRINNN! {*chainsaw revs up*}<br>
        Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all<br>
        danglin from his neck, while his head barely hangs on<br>
        Blood, guts, guns, cuts<br>
        Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts<br>
        <br>
        Chorus: Eminem<br>
        <br>
        Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me<br>
        Girls leave - you ain't nuttin but a slut to me<br>
        Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef<br>
        We ain't gon' never stop beefin I don't squash the beef<br>
        You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead<br>
        for poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said<br>
        But when they kill me - I'm bringin the world with me<br>
        Bitches too! You ain't nuttin but a girl to me<br>
        .. I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)<br>
        Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you (ah-haha)<br>
        I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)<br>
        Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you..<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem]<br>
        Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you<br>
        in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you<br>
        Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!<br>
        I'm tryin to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em<br>
        I ain't ask to rap, but I rap on acid<br>
        Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added<br>
        WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!<br>
        Just criminal intent to sodomize women again<br>
        Eminem offend? NO! Eminem insult<br>
        And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse<br>
        to do it again, THEN, if he does it again<br>
        you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the 10th<br>
        (Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus<br>
        I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest<br>
        A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times<br>
        in a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?<br>
        Serial killer hidin murder material<br>
        in a cereal box on top of your stereo<br>
        Here we go again, we're out of our medicine<br>
        out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in<br>
        <br>
        Chorus (first line starts "Or I'ma kill you!")<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem]<br>
        Eh-heh, know why I say these things?<br>
        Cause lady's screams keep creepin in Shady's dreams<br>
        And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks<br>
        this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!<br>
        TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things<br>
        Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks<br>
        Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows<br>
        just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?<br>
        FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer<br>
        from fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her<br>
        from principal to the study body and counselor<br>
        from in-school to before school to out of school<br>
        I don't even believe in breathin I'm leavin air in your lungs<br>
        just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it<br>
        OKAY, I'M READY TO GO PLAY<br>
        I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.<br>
        I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS ACHE<br>
        You faggots keep eggin me on<br>
        til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?<br>
        SHUT UP! Give me your hands and feet<br>
        I said SHUT UP when I'm talkin to you<br>
        YOU HEAR ME? ANSWER ME!<br>
        <br>
        Chorus (first line starts "Or I'ma kill you!" ninth line starts "Bitch 
        I'ma kill you!")<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem]<br>
        Hahaha, I'm just playin ladies<br>
        You know I love you</font></div>
