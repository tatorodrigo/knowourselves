        We'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar 
        you attend<br>
        Never know what kind of car I'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying 
        then<br>
        You don't want that, neither do I, I don't want to flip when I see you 
        with guys too much pride, between you and I, not a jealous man, but females 
        lie<br>
        But I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two?<br>
