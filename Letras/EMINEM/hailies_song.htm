        I can't sing&middot;but I feel like singing.<br>
        I want to fuckin' sing&middot;cuz I'm happy&middot;yea&middot;I'm happy.<br>
        I got my baby back&middot;yo&middot;check it out...<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 1<br>
        Somedays I sit staring out the window, watchin' this world pass me by<br>
        Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for.<br>
        I almost break down and cry.<br>
        Sometimes I think I'm crazy.<br>
        I'm crazy, oh so crazy.<br>
        Why am I here?<br>
        Am I just wasting my time<br>
        But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy.<br>
        It all makes sense when I look into her eyes<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus<br>
        Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders.<br>
        Everyone's leaning on me<br>
        Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over, but then she comes 
        back to me.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        My baby girl keeps getting' older.<br>
        I watch her grow up with pride.<br>
        People make jokes cuz they don't understand me, they just don't see my 
        real side<br>
        I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy.<br>
        My insecurities could eat me alive<br>
        But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy.<br>
        It all makes sense when I look in her eyes.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 3<br>
        Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter.<br>
        If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father to show 
        her how I feel about her.<br>
        How proud I am that I got her.<br>
        God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't.<br>
        Now you probably get this picture from my public persona that I'ma pistol 
        packin' drug addict who bags on his mama.<br>
        But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest, cuz there's 
        a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul.<br>
        And just know that I grow colder the older I grow.<br>
        This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold, and this load 
        is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin'.<br>
        Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?<br>
        Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself, but I got a wife 
        that's determined to make my life livin' hell.<br>
        But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt.<br>
        So many chances, man, it's too bad - could have had someone else<br>
        But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted, 
        so here's what I'm facin'&middot;3 felonies, 6 years of probation.<br>
        I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman.<br>
        I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman.<br>
        Man, I should have seen it coming.<br>
        What did I stick my penis up in?<br>
        Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin.'<br>
        But fuck it, it's over.<br>
        There's no more reason to cry no more.<br>
        I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore (Hailie).<br>
        So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya.<br>
        Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner.<br>
        And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted.<br>
        It's like the greatest gift you could get.<br>
        The weight has been lifted.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outro<br>
        Told you I can't sing..<br>
        Oh well...<br>
        I tried...<br>
        Hailie, remember when I said if you ever need anything,<br>
        Daddy would be right there?<br>
        Guess what?<br>
        Daddy's here, and I ain't going nowhere, baby.<br>
        I love you&middot;(kiss)</font></div>
