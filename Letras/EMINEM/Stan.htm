        Dido<br>
        My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..<br>
        got out of bed at all<br>
        The morning rain clouds up my window..<br>
        and I can't see at all<br>
        And even if I could it'll all be gray,<br>
        but your picture on my wall<br>
        It reminds me, that it's not so bad,<br>
        it's not so bad..<br>
        <br>
        1st Chorus: volume gradually grows over raindrop background<br>
        2nd Chorus: full volume with beat right after "thunder" noise<br>

        Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin<br>
        I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom<br>
        I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em<br>
        There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin<br>
        Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em<br>
        but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?<br>
        My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father<br>
        If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?<br>
        I'ma name her Bonnie<br>
        I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry<br>
        I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him<br>
        I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan<br>
        I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam<br>
        I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man<br>
        I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was fat<br>
        Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,<br>
        just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br>
        This is Stan<br>
        <br>
        {Chorus: Dido}<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem as 'Stan']<br>
        Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br>
        I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans<br>
        If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert<br>
        you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br>
        That's my little brother man, he's only six years old<br>
        We waited in the blistering cold for you,<br>
        four hours and you just said, "No."<br>
        That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol<br>
        He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br>
        I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to<br>
        Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you<br>
        you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way<br>
        I never knew my father neither;<br>
        he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<br>
        I can relate to what you're saying in your songs<br>
        so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on<br>
        cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br>
        I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest<br>
        Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds<br>
        It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me<br>
        See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it<br>
        My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7<br>
        But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does<br>
        She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up<br>
        You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br>
        Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.<br>
        We should be together too<br>
        <br>
        {Chorus: Dido}<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem as 'Stan']<br>
        Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,<br>
        this'll be the last package I ever send your ass<br>
        It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?<br>
        I know you got my last two letters;<br>
        I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<br>
        So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br>
        I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway<br>
        Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?<br>
        You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"<br>
        about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning<br>
        but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?<br>
        That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<br>
        Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy<br>
        and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br>
        I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall<br>
        I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<br>
        You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br>
        And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it<br>
        I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me<br>
        See Slim; {*screaming*} Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!<br>
        Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk<br>
        but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you<br>
        cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too<br>
        Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<br>
        Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?<br>
        {*car tires squeal*} {*CRASH*}<br>
        .. {*brief silence*} .. {*LOUD splash*}<br>
        <br>
        {Chorus: Dido}<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem]<br>
        Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<br>
        You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<br>
        Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<br>
        and here's an autograph for your brother,<br>
        I wrote it on the Starter cap<br>
        I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you<br>
        Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br>
        But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?<br>
        I say that shit just clownin dogg,<br>
        c'mon - how fucked up is you?<br>
        You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling<br>
        to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<br>
        And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br>
        That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other<br>
        I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br>
        or maybe you just need to treat her better<br>
        I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br>
        before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine<br>
        if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan<br>
        why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<br>
        I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br>
        I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br>
        Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br>
        and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<br>
        and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br>
        Come to think about, his name was.. it was you<br>
        Damn!</font></div>
