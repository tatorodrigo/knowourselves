        Yo...<br>
        Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns,<br>
        Never was a gangsta, till I graduated to one<br>
        And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'.<br>
        Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin' willin' to stick out my 
        neck, for respect if it meant life or death, never live to regret what 
        I said when you're me, people just want to see, if its true, if its you, 
        what you say in your rap's, what you do so they feel, as part of your 
        obligation to fulfill, when they see you on the streets, face to face, 
        are you for real in confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're 
        in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed if you feel it, kill it, 
        if you conceal it, reveal it.<br>
        Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it till 
        its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, I need a good reason to give this 
        trigger a good squeeze...<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus<br>
        I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge,<br>
        I'll never fall or fold up<br>
        I'm a soldier,<br>
        Even if my collar bones crush or crumble,<br>
        I will never slip or stumble<br>
        I'm a soldier,<br>
        These shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge,<br>
        I'll never fall or fold up<br>
        I'm a soldier,<br>
        Even if my collar bones crush or crumble,<br>
        I will never stumble<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        I love pissin' you off, it gets me off, like my lawyers, when the fuckin' 
        judge lets me off all you motherfuckas gotta do is set me off,<br>
        I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off<br>
        I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bring it's news, pistol whippin' motherfuckin' 
        bouncers, six-two, who needs bullets?<br>
        Soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets, an excellent method to get rid of 
        the next bully<br>
        It's actually better cause instead you murderin', you can hurt em' and 
        come back again and kick dirt at em it's like pourin' salt in the wounds, 
        assault and get sued, you can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the 
        room everybody halts and stops, calls the cops, all you see is bitches 
        comin' out their halter tops runnin' and duckin' out to the Hot Rocks 
        parking lot, you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, cus...<br>
        <br>

        I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to em, give it back 
        to these damn critics and sock it to em<br>
        I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence,<br>
        I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it you motherfuckas 
        could never do it like I could do it, don't even try it, you'll look stupid, 
        do not pursue it don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest,<br>
        I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch so ticky-tock listen 
        as the sound ticks on the clock, listen to the sound of Kim as she licks 
        on a cock listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen, 
        motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again<br>
        Full of controversy until I retire my jersey, till the fire inside dies 
        and expires at thirty and Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers 
        that verse me, and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity<br>
        I'm a...<br>
