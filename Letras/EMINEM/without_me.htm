        give ya a little bit of me mixed with some hard liquor some vodka that'll

        by the Dr. when I'm not cooperating when I'm rocking the table while he's 
        operating you waited this long now stop debating cuz I'm back,<br>
        I'm on the rag and ovulating I know that you got a job Ms.<br>
        Cheney but your husbands heart problem's complicating<br>
        So the FCC wont let me be or let me be me so let me see they tried to 
        shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me<br>
        So come on and dip, bum on your lips fuck that, cum on your lips and some 
        on your tits and get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy<br>
        I just settled all my lawsuits Fuck YOU DEBBIE!<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me cuz we need 
        a little controversy, cuz it feels so empty without me<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        Little hellions kids feeling rebellious embarrassed, their parents still 
        listen to Elvis they start feeling the prisoners helpless, 'til someone 
        comes along on a mission and yells &quot;bitch&quot;<br>
        A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution, pollutin the air 
        waves a rebel so let me just revel an bask, in the fact that I got everyone 
        kissing my ass and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so 
        damn much of my ass you ask for me?<br>
        Well I'm back (batman sound) fix your bent antennae tune it in and then 
        I'm gonna enter in and up under your skin like a splinter<br>
        The center of attention back for the winter<br>
        I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling<br>
        Infesting in your kids ears and nesting<br>
        Testing &quot;Attention Please&quot; feel the tension soon as someone 
        mentions me here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free<br>
        A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 3<br>
        A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this 
        shit that shit.<br>
        Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked worse than them little Limp 
        Bizkit bastards, and Moby you can get stomped by Obie, you 36 year old 
        bald headed fag blow me<br>
        You don't know me, you're too old let go its over, nobody listens to techno<br>
        Now lets go, give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of 
        new insults I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince 
        turned himself into a symbol<br>
        But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me<br>
        So this must mean I'm disgusting, but its just me I'm just obscene<br>
        Though I'm not the first king of controversy<br>
        I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black Music so selfishly 
        and use it to get myself wealthy (Hey) there's a concept that works 20 
        million other white rappers emerge but no matter how many fish in the 
        sea it'd be so empty without me<br>
