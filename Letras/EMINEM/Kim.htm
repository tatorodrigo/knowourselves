        Aww look at daddy's baby girl<br>
        That's daddy baby<br>
        Little sleepy head<br>
        Yesterday I changed your diaper<br>
        Wiped you and powdered you<br>
        How did you get so big?<br>
        Can't believe it now your two<br>
        Baby you're so precious<br>
        Daddy's so proud of you<br>
        Sit down bitch<br>
        If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you<br>
        <br>
        [Eminem](Eminem as Kim)<br>
        (Okay)<br>
        Don't make me wake this baby<br>
        She don't need to see what I'm about to do<br>
        Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?<br>
        How could you?<br>
        Just leave me and love him out the blue<br>
        Oh, what's a matter Kim?<br>
        Am I too loud for you?<br>
        Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time<br>
        At first, I'm like all right<br>
        You wanna throw me out? That's fine!<br>
        But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?<br>
        This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!<br>
        How could you let him sleep in our bed?<br>
        Look at Kim<br>
        Look at your husband now!<br>
        (No!)<br>
        I said look at him!<br>
        He ain't so hot now is he?<br>
        Little punk!<br>
        (Why are you doing this?)<br>
        Shut the fuck up!<br>
        (You're drunk! You're never going to get away at this!)<br>
        You think I give a fuck!<br>
        Come on we're going for a ride bitch<br>
        (No!)<br>
        Sit up front<br>
        (Well I can't just leave Haley alone, what if she wakes up?)<br>
        We'll be right back<br>
        Well I will you'll be in the trunk<br>
        <br>
        1 - So long, bitch you did me so wrong<br>
        I don't wanna go on<br>
        Living in this world without you<br>
        <br>
        Repeat 1<br>
        <br>
        You really fucked me Kim<br>
        You really did a number on me<br>
        Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me<br>
        But we was kids then Kim, I was only 18<br>
        That was years ago<br>
        I thought we wiped the slate clean<br>
        That's fucked up!<br>
        (I love you!)<br>
        Oh God my brain is racing<br>
        (I love you!)<br>
        What are you doing?<br>
        Change the station I hate this song!<br>
        Does this look like a big joke?<br>
        (No!)<br>
        There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat<br>
        In your living room, ha-ha<br>
        What you think I'm kiddin' you?<br>
        You loved him didn't you?<br>
        (No!)<br>
        Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me<br>
        What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?<br>
        Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me<br>
        Kim, KIM!<br>
        Why don't you like me?<br>
        You think I'm ugly don't you<br>
        (It's not that!)<br>
        No you think I'm ugly<br>
        (Baby)<br>
        Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me<br>
        I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!<br>
        I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE YOU<br>
        OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU<br>
        How the fuck could you do this to me?<br>
        (Sorry!)<br>
        How the fuck could you do this to me?<br>
        <br>
        Repeat 1 (2x)<br>
        <br>
        Come on get out<br>
        (I can't I'm scared)<br>
        I said get out bitch!<br>
        (Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)<br>
        (Please I love you, look we can just take Haley and leave)<br>
        Fuck you, you did this to us<br>
        You did it, it's your fault<br>
        Oh my God I'm crackin' up<br>
        Get a grip Marshall<br>
        Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?<br>
        And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie<br>
        That was funny wasn't it?<br>
        (Yes!)<br>
        That was funny wasn't it?<br>
        (Yes!)<br>
        See it all makes sense, doesn't it?<br>
        You and your husband have a fight<br>
        One of you tries to grab a knife<br>
        And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced<br>
        (No!)<br>
        And while this is goin' on<br>
        His son just woke up and he just walks in<br>
        She panics and he gets his throat cut<br>
        (Oh my God!)<br>
        So now they both dead and you slash your own throat<br>
        So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note<br>
        I should have known better when you started to act weird<br>
        We could've...HEY! Where you going? Get back here!<br>
        You can't run from me Kim<br>
        It's just us, nobody else!<br>
        You're only making this harder on yourself<br>
        Ha! Ha! Got'cha!<br>
        (Ahh!)<br>
        Ha! Go ahead yell!<br>
        Here I'll scream with you!<br>
        AH SOMEBODY HELP!<br>
        Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?<br>
        Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin to you<br>
        You were supposed to love me<br>
        {*Kim choking*}<br>
        NOW BLEED! BITCH BLEED!<br>
