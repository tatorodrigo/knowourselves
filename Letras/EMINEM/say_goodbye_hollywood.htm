        X2<br>
        Sayin' goodbye,<br>
        I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood<br>
        Sayin' goodbye,<br>
        I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood<br>
        Sayin' goodbye,<br>
        I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood<br>
        Sayin' goodbye,<br>
        I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood<br>
        (Hollywood why do I feel this way?)<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 1<br>
        I thought I had it all figured out, I did, I thought I was tough enough 
        to stick it out with Kim but I wasn't tough enough, to juggle two things 
        at once,<br>
        I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs which should've been a reason 
        enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave.<br>
        How come I couldn't see this shit myself?<br>
        it's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt, knowin' damn well she 
        wasn't gonna be there when I fell to catch me, the minute shit was heated, 
        she just bailed,<br>
        I'm standin' here swingin' like thirty people by myself I couldn't even 
        see the millimeter when it fell, turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater 
        in his belt saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground,<br>
        I just sold two million records,<br>
        I don't need to go to jail<br>
        I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female,<br>
        I need to slow down, get my feet on solid ground so for now I'm...<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        I, bury my face in comic books, cus I don't want to look at nothin', this 
        world's too much, I've swallowed all I could<br>
        If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good, just 
        say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
        I probably should, these problems are piling all at once, cus everything 
        that bothers me, I got it bottled up<br>
        I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up,<br>
        I gotta get up, thank God,<br>
        I got a little girl and I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good,<br>
        I'd be to my daughter, layin' in the bottom of the mud must be in my blood 
        cus I don't know how I do it, all I know is I don't want to follow in 
        the footsteps of my dad, cus I hate him so bad, the worst fear that I 
        had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass man if you could understand 
        why I am the way that I am, what do I say to my fans when I tell 'em (I'm)...<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 3<br>
        I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it, for me to have this 
        much appeal like this is sick this is not a game, this fame, in real life 
        this is sick, publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick fuck the 
        guns, I'm done,<br>
        I'll never look at Gats, if I scrap,<br>
        I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass<br>
        I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact,<br>
        I've sacrificed everything I have<br>
        I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is wack, this is 
        more than I ever coulda asked everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, 
        or mask, what about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?<br>
        It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt,<br>
        I'm trapped, if I could go back,<br>
        I never woulda rapped<br>
        I sold my soul to the devil,<br>
        I'll never get it back,<br>
        I just wanna leave this game with level head intact<br>
        Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein', everything blow up and all 
        you did was just grow up mcing<br>
        It's fuckin' crazy, cus all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never 
        had, but instead I forced us to live alienated so I'm sayin'...<br>
        <br>

        Goodbye<br>
        Goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)<br>
        Please don't cry for me (It's been real)<br>
        When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)<br>
