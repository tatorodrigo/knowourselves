        just let it run<br>
        A yo turn the beat up a little bit<br>
        A yo<br>
        This song is for anyone<br>
        Fuck it shut up and listen<br>
        <br>
        A yo,<br>
        I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag<br>
        Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be<br>
        The most meanest Mcee on this -- on this Earth<br>
        And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse<br>
        And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works<br>
        And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve<br>
        All this tension dispensin me sentences gettin it<br>
        Stress that's been eaten me recently offa this chest<br>
        And I rest again peacefully --<br>
        But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone<br>
        When you freaks see me out in the streets<br>
        when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter<br>
        To not come and speak to me --<br>
        I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing<br>
        I'm not Mr. N'Sync I'm not what your friends think<br>
        I'm not Mr. friendly I can be a prick<br>
        If you tip me my tank is on empty<br>
        No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm liftin you 10 feet<br>
        In the air I don't care who is there and who saw me jus jaw you<br>
        Go call you a lawyer go file you a lawsuit<br>
        I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe<br>
        I'm tired of all you --<br>
        I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me<br>
        <br>
        [HOOK]<br>
        And I am whatever you say I am<br>
        If I wasn't then why would I say I am<br>
        In the paper, the news everyday I am<br>
        Radio won't even play my jam<br>
        Cuz I am whatever you say I am<br>
        If I wasn't then why would I say I am<br>
        In the paper, the news everyday I am<br>
        I don't know it's just the way I am<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes I just feel like my father<br>
        I hate to be bothered<br>
        With alla this nonsense it's constant<br>
        Oh it's his lyrical content the song "Guilty Concience" <br>
        as gotten such rotten responses<br>
        And all-a this controversy circles me<br>
        And it seems like the media immedietly<br>
        Points a finger at me --<br>
        So I point one back at em but not the index or pinky<br>
        Or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up<br>
        When you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up<br>
        With the bullshit they pull cuz they fulla shit too<br>
        When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school<br>
        And they blame it on Marilyn --<br>
        And the heroin where were the parents at<br>
        And look where it's at<br>
        Middle America now it's a tragedy now it's so sad to see<br>
        An upperclass city havin this happenin --<br>
        Then attack Eminem cuz I rap this way<br>
        But I'm glad cuz they feed me the fuel that I need<br>
        For the fire to burn in it's burnin and I have returned<br>
        <br>
        [HOOK]<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick and tired of being admired<br>
        That I wish I would just die or get fired<br>
        And drop from my label and stop with the fables<br>
        I'm not gonna be able to top what my name is<br>
        And pigeon-holed into some pop-y sensation<br>
        To cop me rotation at rock-an-roll stations<br>
        And I just do not got the patience --<br>
        To deal with these cocky Caucasians<br>
        Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black<br>
        Cuz I talk wit an accent and grab on my balls<br>
        So they always keep askin the same fucking questions<br>
        What school did I go to what hood I grew up in<br>
        And why the who what when the where and the how<br>
        till I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out<br>
        Cuz they drivin me crazy --<br>
        I can't take it I'm racin I'm pacin<br>
        I stand and I sit<br>
        I'm thankful for every fan that I get<br>
        But I can't take a shit in the bathroom<br>
        Without someone standin by it<br>
        No i won't sign your autograph<br>
        You can call me an asshole I'm glad<br>
        <br>
        Cuz I am whatever you say I am<br>
        If I wasn't then why would I say I am<br>
        In the paper, the news everyday I am<br>
        Radio won't even play my jam<br>
        Cuz I am whatever you say I am<br>
        If I wasn't then why would I say I am<br>
        In the paper, the news everyday I am<br>
        I don't know it's just the way I am</font></div>
