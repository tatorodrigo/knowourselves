        I have your attention please<br>
        May I have your attention please<br>
        Will the real Slim Shady please stand up<br>
        I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up<br>
        We're gonna have a problem here<br>
        <br>
        Ya’ll act like you never seen a white person before<br>
        Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door<br>
        Started whoopin her ass worst than before<br>
        They first were dirvorced throwing her over furniture (scream)<br>
        It’s the return of the<br>
        (Aw wait, no way, your kidding, he didn’t just say what I think he did, 
        did he?)<br>
        And Dr Dre said...<br>
        Nothing you idiot Dr Dre’s dead hes locked in my basement (haha)<br>
        Femenist women loved Eminem<br>
        Chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him<br>
        Look at him walking around grabbing his you know what<br>
        Flipping at you know who (yeah but he's so cute though)<br>
        Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<br>
        But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms<br>
        Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let Loose<br>
        But I can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<br>
        My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips<br>
        And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss<br>
        And that’s the messege that we deliver to little kids<br>
        And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<br>
        Of course there gonna know what intercourse is<br>
        By the time they hit 4th grade<br>
        They got the discovery channel don’t they<br>
        We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us cannabals<br>
        Who cut other people open like cantoloupes<br>
        But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<br>
        Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<br>
        But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote<br>
        Women wear your pantyhoes, sing the chorus and it goes<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        Im Slim Shady<br>
        Yes I'm the real Shady<br>
        All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>
        So won't the real slim shady<br>
        Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up<br>
        Cuz I'm Slim Shady<br>
        Yes I'm the real Shady<br>
        All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>
        So won't the real Slim Shady<br>
        Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up<br>
        <br>
        Will Smith don’t gotta cuss in his raps to sell records<br>
        Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too<br>
        You think I give a damm about a grammy<br>
        Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me<br>
        (But Slim what if you win, wouldn’t it be weird)<br>
        Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here<br>
        So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears<br>
        Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs<br>
        So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst<br>
        And hear them argue over who she gave head to first<br>
        Little bitch put me on blast on MTV<br>
        (Yeah, he's cute but I think hes married to Kim, hehe)<br>
        I should download an audio on MP3<br>
        And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (scream)<br>
        I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me<br>
        So I been sent here to destroy you<br>
        And there,s a million of us just like me<br>
        Who cuss like me<br>
        Who just don’t give a fuck like me<br>
        Who dress like me<br>
        Walk talk and act like me<br>
        It just might be<br>
        The next best thing<br>
        But not quite me<br>

        Chrous<br>
        <br>
        I'm like a headtrip to listen to<br>
        Cuz I'm only giving you<br>
        Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room<br>
        The only diffreance is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all<br>
        And I don’t got to be false or sugar coat it at all<br>
        I just get on the mic and spit it<br>
        Whether you like to admit it<br>
        I just shit it Better than 90% of you rappers out there<br>
        Then you wonder how can these kids kids eat these albums, like valiums<br>
        It's funny cuz at the rate I'm going when I'm 30<br>
        I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting<br>
        Pinching nurses asses when jacking off with Jergins<br>
        And I'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working<br>
        And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'<br>
        He could be working at Burger King spittin' on your onion rings<br>
        Or in the parking lot circling, screaming I don’t give a fuck<br>
        With his windows down and his system up<br>
        So will the real Shady please stand up<br>
        And put one of those fingers on each hand up<br>
        And to be proud to out of your mind and out of control<br>
        And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go<br>
        <br>
        Chrous (2X)<br>
        <br>
        (laugh)<br>
