        (Dre)<br>
        Oh, so I'm out the game, huh<br>
        (Eminem)<br>
        Yo Dre, we ridin'?<br>
        (Dre)<br>
        Whatever...<br>
        (Eminem)<br>
        Well I'm wit ya homie<br>
        (Dre)<br>
        Okay, well let's handle the small shit<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 1<br>
        (Eminem)<br>
        I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I 
        slur up spit grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit, 
        corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch thick 'n rich, sick and 
        twisted, Mr. Buttersworth, Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's 
        worth till the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth, and if I 
        fumble a verse, keep going, first take I make mistakes just keep it, no 
        punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit fake shit, if I ever take shit 
        I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dre)<br>
        Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane, been here longer 
        than anyone in the game and I ain't got to lie about my age, &quot;But 
        what about Jermaine?&quot;<br>
        Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name and don't 
        think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin', I'm 
        a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked, when I see you, I'ma 
        step on you and not even know it you midget, mini-me with a bunch of mini-yous, 
        runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools over eighty million records 
        sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say it whenever 
        you sayin' it just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, 
        so who you playin' wit, huh?<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        (Eminem)<br>
        Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this, amatuers drink 
        veteran piss from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up or confuse me with 
        a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri we'll rub it in, every club you're in, 
        we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain<br>
        Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dre)<br>
        If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry, that could 
        save it when I'm gone and buried to make sure the tradition carries on, 
        I would<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Eminem)<br>
        If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dre)<br>
        From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'ma only sting when I cornered<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Eminem)<br>
        And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning and swing to knock 
        somebody's fuckin' head off, cus I know if they get up, I won't get a 
        chance to let off another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give 
        a fuck, White-Pac, so much spunk when I was little I knew I would blow 
        up and sell a mill, or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dre)<br>
        And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron, I'm unstoppable, 
        I'm alive and on top again there's no obstacle that I can't conquer so 
        come along wit us&middot;.Cmon<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 3<br>
        (Dre)<br>
        Now anybody who knows Dre, knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' 
        all day but I handled my business, cus it' work before play, don't look 
        for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet however you want it, you can have 
        it your way, you fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day bullet with your 
        name, sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that 
        doorway cus this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it, and you'll 
        die tryin' to violate it fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dialated<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Eminem)<br>
        Like my old lady?<br>
        Cus what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean is two different 
        things, depending on your mood if it swings<br>
        think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything, catch 
        a contact and I'm gone and I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's 
        my launch pad<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dre)<br>
        And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything catch a contract 
        on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre, you better get a vest 
        and invest in something to protect your head and neck<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Eminem)<br>
        And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth, I joke when I say 
        I'm the best, in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest and if 
        I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death five mics in the 
        Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect 
        'fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outro<br>
        (Dre)<br>
        Watch your fuckin' mouth<br>
        (Timbaland)<br>
        Yo this Timbaland.<br>
        Tell'em I said suck&middot;my dick</font></div>
