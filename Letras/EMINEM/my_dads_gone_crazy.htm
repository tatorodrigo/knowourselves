        There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high, no plane 
        that I can't learn how to fly what do I gotta do to get through to you, 
        to show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?<br>
        Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off, and got'em pickled 
        and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall with my framed autographed 
        sunglasses with Elton John's name on my GLAAD wall, I'm out the closet, 
        I've been lyin' my ass off<br>
        All this time me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off (Suck it, Marshall).<br>
        So tell Laura and her husband to back off before I push this muthafuckin' 
        button and blast off and launch one at these Russians and that's all blow 
        every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off.<br>
        When will it stop?<br>
        When will I knock the crap off?<br>
        Hailie, tell 'em baby,(My Dad's Lost It!!)<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus<br>
        There's really nothin' else to say, I...<br>
        I can't explain it<br>
        I think my dad's gone crazy<br>
        A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby<br>
        I think my dad's gone crazy<br>
        There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me<br>
        I think my dad's gone crazy<br>
        There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie<br>
        I think my dad's gone crazy<br>

        It's like my mother always told me, rana rana rana rana rana rana rana 
        rana rana rana and codeine and goddammit you little muthafucker if you 
        ain't got nuthin' nice to say then don't say nuthin'&middot;..uh, fuck 
        that shit bitch eat a muthafuckin' dick, chew on a prick and lick a million 
        muthafuckin' cocks per second, I'd rather put out a muthafuckin' gospel 
        record<br>
        I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy, and have pussy lips glued 
        to my face with a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows quit 
        givin' me my ammo.<br>
        Can't you see why I'm so mean?<br>
        If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.<br>
        I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo, catch a homo by his toe, 
        man I don't know no more am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?<br>

        My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time, can 
        make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme see what you're seein' is a 
        genius at work, which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it 
        at first cus when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth 
        before I'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' 
        lightning twice at once and die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son and 
        walk around the rest of my life spit on, and kicked and hit with shit 
        everytime I sung like R. Kelly as soon as &quot;Bump and Grind&quot; comes 
        on.<br>
        More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl inside of 
        a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' 
        at the sky, till clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade and 
        that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids 
        love it.<br>

        I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither...<br>
