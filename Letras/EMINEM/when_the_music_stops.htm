        or show love, or would it matter?<br>
        Could never be the lead-off batter if there ain't shit for me to feed 
        off, I'm see-saw battlin' but there's way too much at stake for me to 
        be fake, there's too much on my plate, I done came way too far in this 
        game, to turn and walk away, and not say what I got to say what the fuck

        'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back I'll get up 'fore I get 
        down, gun myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out<br>

        Ain't no getting' rid of McVeigh, if so you woulda tried, the only way 
        I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide<br>
        I have died clinically, arrived ride back at my enemies' crib with Hennessey, 
        got drunk then I finish him<br>
        I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy, physically fitted to be the most 
        dangerous nigga with beef<br>
        I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, dilligently, I'm not 
        what you think<br>
        I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered, I can't stay away from 
        a razor, I just want my face in a paper<br>
        I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres<br>
        I'll murder you, I gauge have me turn into a mad man, son of sam bitch, 
        I'm surgical<br>

        I was happy havin' a deal at first, thought money would make me happy, 
        but it only made my pain worse<br>
        It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dog, and you 
        ain't got nuttin' left but your word and your balls and you're stressed 
        from the calls of your new friends, beggin' with their hands out, checkin' 
        for your record when it's sellin' when it ain't that's the end, no laughs, 
        no friends, no girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin you think 
        DAMN!<br>
        When you slam into the wall, and you fall out the car and try to crawl 
        with one arm<br>
        I'm bout to lose it all, in a pool of alcohol, if my funeral's tomorrow, 
        wonder would they even call when the music stops<br>

        Let's see how many of your men loyal, when I pull up lookin' for you with 
        a pistol, sippin' a can of penzoil<br>
        I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust your head just explode with 
        red stuff, I'm handcuffed tossed in the paddywagon, braggin' about how 
        you shouted, like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas<br>
        If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance, understand, I can enhance 
        the spirit of man<br>
        Death itself, it can hurt me, just the thought of dyin' alone that really 
        irks me you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk, be smart and 
        stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark hug the floor while we 
        playin' tug-of-war with your life, fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather 
        fuck a whore with a knife deliver that shit that coroner's like, you hype, 
        poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga you're a gonner at night when the 
        music stops<br>
