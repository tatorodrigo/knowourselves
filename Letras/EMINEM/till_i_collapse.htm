        Sometimes you feel tired, feel weak,<br>
        When you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.<br>
        But you gotta search within you, find that inner strength<br>
        And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give 
        up<br>
        And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your 
        face&middot;and collapse<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 1<br>
        Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em, till the 
        day, that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' em<br>
        Cuz when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin'em and I am not hip-hop and I'm 
        just not Eminem subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin' em, women are 
        caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom, adrenalin shots of penicillin 
        could not get the illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough<br>
        The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain a minimal swap to cop millions 
        of Pac listeners your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear 
        it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us you hear it a lot, lyrics 
        to shock.<br>
        Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?<br>
        Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot listen up, you bizzels forgot, 
        slizzel does not give a fuck<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus<br>
        Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out, till my legs give out, 
        can't shut my mouth<br>
        Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out,<br>
        I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Till the roof 
        comes off, till the lights go out,<br>
        (Until the roof) till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
        (The roof comes off)<br>
        Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out,<br>
        (Until my legs) I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.<br>
        (Give out from underneath me)<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get when you're real 
        and you spit an people are feelin' ya shit<br>
        This is your moment and every single minute you spend tryin' to hold on 
        to it, cuz you may never get it again so while you're in it try to get 
        as much shit as you can and when your run is over just admit when it's 
        at its end cuz I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in, I 
        got a list here's the order of my list that it's in<br>
        It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, 
        Nas and then me<br>
        But in this industry, I'm the cause of a lot of envy so when I'm not put 
        on this list, the shit does not offend me<br>
        That's why you see me walkin' around like nothin's bothering me, even 
        though half you people gotta fuckin' problem with me you hate it but you 
        know respect you got to give me.<br>
        The press's wet dream like Bobby an Whitney Nate hit me...</font></div>
