        Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?<br>
        I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against.<br>
        Picket signs for my wicked rhymes.<br>
        Look at the times.<br>
        Sick is the mind of the motha fuckin' kid that's behind all this commotion.<br>
        Emotions run deep as ocean's explodin.<br>
        ' Tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin.'<br>
        Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin.<br>
        ' Keep kickin' ass in the mornin,' an' takin' names in the evening.<br>
        Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth.<br>
        See, they can trigger me but they never figure me out.<br>
        Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now.<br>
        Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus 2X<br>
        I'm sorry, Mama.<br>
        I never meant to hurt you.<br>
        I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 2<br>
        I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it.<br>
        So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it, I'ma expose it.<br>
        I'll take you back to 73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD.<br>
        I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months.<br>
        My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch, cuz he split.<br>
        I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye.<br>
        No, I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die.<br>
        I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side.<br>
        Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try<br>
        to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake.<br>
        I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human.<br>
        But I'm man enough to face them today.<br>
        What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest shit I did 
        was take them bullets out of that gun.<br>
        Cuz id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot Kim an' him both.<br>
        It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus 2X<br>

        Now I would never dis my own mama just to get recognition.<br>
        Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin,'<br>
        But put yourself in my position.<br>
        Just try to envision witnessin' your Mama poppin' prescription pills in 
        the kitchen,<br>
        bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shits missin.'<br>
        Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome.<br>
        My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew 
        up, now I blew up.<br>
        It makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?<br>
        Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?<br>
        So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?<br>
        But guess what, yer gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely.<br>
        An' Nathan's getting' up so quick, he's gonna know that your phoney.<br>
        And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful.<br>
        But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral.<br>
        See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong.<br>
        Bitch, do ya song.<br>
        Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom.<br>
        But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get.<br>
        You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit.<br>
        Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?<br>
        Well, guess what, I am dead.<br>
        Dead to you as can be.<br>
