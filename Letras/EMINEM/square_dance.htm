        Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new and improved, you know who<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verse 1<br>
        Never been the type to bend or budge, the wrong button to push, no friend 
        of Bush<br>
        I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese.<br>
        I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease<br>
        All these people I had to leave in limbo, I'm back now, I've come to release 
        this info I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple, can-a-bitch 
        don't want no beef with Slim?<br>
        Noooo!<br>
        Not even on my radar, so won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and 
        stay off and follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from s&#142;ance 
        to s&#142;ance, aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chorus X2<br>
        C'mon now, let's all get on down, let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good 
        ol' time<br>

        Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back.<br>
        Boo!<br>
        The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back with a plan to ambush this 
        Bush administration, mush the Senate's face in, push this generation of 
        kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like, 
        this white hot light that I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt, oh 
        no I won't leave no stone unturned<br>
        Oh no I won't leave, won't go nowhere, do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there 
        oh yeah don't think I won't go there, go to Beirut and do a show there 
        yah you laugh till your muthafuckin' ass gets drafted, while you're at 
        band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen till you fuck around, get an 
        anthrax napkin, inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping open the 
        plastic and then you stand back gasping, fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtracks 
        crashin' all this terror America demands action, next thing you know you've 
        got Uncle Sam's ass askin' to join the army or what you'll do for their 
        Navy.<br>
        You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen<br>
        You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans.<br>
        I'm twenty-eight, they're gonna take you 'fore they take me<br>
        Crazy insane or insane crazy?<br>
        When I say Hussein, you say Shady<br>
        My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait, arraigned two days late, 
        the date's today, hang me!<br>
        <br>
