        no Santa Claus<br>
        It was all a lie<br>
        No man in the moon<br>
        Just a big light in the sky<br>
        I hear Disneyland<br>
        Might lose Mickey Mouse<br>
        In some giant hostile corporate shake-up<br>
        Tell me it's a nightmare<br>
        Please wake me up<br>
        (Say it isn't so)<br>
        I found a book of matches<br>
        From someplace we've never been<br>
        How come you hang the phone up<br>
        The minute I walk in<br>
        Last night I had this dream<br>
        That I was losing you<br>
        I woke up in a cold sweat shaking<br>
        Rescue me my heart is breaking<br>
        <br>
        Chorus:<br>
        Say it isn't so (tell me it's not true)<br>
        Say it isn't so (I believe in you)<br>
        Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)<br>
        They did it all with strings<br>
        Say everything's alright (couldn't be, not you)<br>
        Say it isn't so<br>
        Superman don't fly<br>
        Elvis Presley died<br>
        They deep fried the king<br>
        Like some tacky cheesy bathing beauty<br>
        Dancing on the beach in a bad b-movie<br>
        <br>
        Chorus 1:<br>
        Say it isn't so (tell me it's not true)<br>
        Say it isn't so (I believe in you)<br>
        Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)<br>
        Say everything's alright (couldn't be, not you)<br>
        <br>
        Chorus 2:<br>
        Say it isn't so (don't give up on me)<br>
        Say it isn't so (don't give up on you)<br>
        Get me through the night (we'll make it through)<br>
        Make everything alright (couldn't be, not you)<br>
        Say it isn't so..<br>
