        loneliness has always been a friend of mine<br>
        I'm leaving my life in your hands<br>
        People say I'm crazy and that I am blind<br>
        Risking it all in a glance<br>
        And how you got me blind is still a mystery<br>
        I can't get you out of my head<br>
        Don't care what is written in your history<br>
        As long as you're here with me<br>
        <br>
        Chorus:<br>
        I don't care who you are<br>
        Where you're from<br>
        What you did<br>
        As long as you love me<br>
        Who you are<br>
        Where you're from<br>
        Don't care what you did<br>
        As long as you love me<br>
        <br>
        Every little thing that you have said and done<br>
        Feels like it's deep within me<br>
        Doesn't really matter if you're on the run<br>
        It seems like we're meant to be<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        Bridge:<br>
        I've tried to hide it so that no one knows<br>
        But I guess it shows<br>
        When you look into my eyes<br>
        What you did and where you are comin'<br>
        from<br>
        I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        Who you are<br>
        Where you're from<br>
        Don't care what you did<br>
        As long as you love me<br>
