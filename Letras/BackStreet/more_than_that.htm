        can see that you've been crying<br>
        You can't hide it with a lie<br>
        What's the use in you denying<br>
        The words you have at home<br>
        <br>
        I heard him promise you forever<br>
        But forevers come and go<br>
        Baby he would say whatever<br>
        It takes to keep you alive<br>
        Tell the truth between the lines<br>
        <br>
        Oh I will love you more than that<br>
        I won't say those words, then take them back<br>
        Don't give lonliness a chance<br>
        Baby listen to me when I say<br>
        I will love you more than that<br>
        <br>
        Baby you deserve much better<br>
        What's the use in holding on<br>
        Don't you see it's now or never<br>
        Just why you can't be friends<br>
        Baby knowing in the end<br>
        <br>
        And I will love you more than that<br>
        I won't say those words, then take them back<br>
        Don't give lonliness a chance<br>
        Baby listen to me when I say<br>
        <br>
        (bridge)<br>
        There's not a day that passes by<br>
        I don't wonder why we haven't tried<br>
        It's not too late to change your mind<br>
        And take my hand, don't say goodbye<br>
        <br>
        I will love you more than that<br>
        I won't say those words, then take them back<br>
        <br>
        Oh I will love you more than that<br>
        I won't say those words, then take them back<br>
        Don't give lonliness a chance<br>
        Baby listen to me when I say<br>
        I will love you more than that<br>
        <br>
        Oh I will love you more than that<br>
