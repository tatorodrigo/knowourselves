        a ghost down in the hall<br>
        There's a ghoul upon the bed<br>
        There's something in the walls<br>
        There's blood up on the stairs<br>
        And it's floating through the room<br>
        And there's nothing I can see<br>

        And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me<br>
        And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?<br>
        You put a knife in my back<br>
        Shot an arrow in me!<br>
