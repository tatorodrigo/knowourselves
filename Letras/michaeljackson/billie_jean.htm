        Verse<br>
        She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
        I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one<br>
        Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
        She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
        2nd Verse<br>
        She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene<br>
        Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one<br>
        Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
        <br>
        Bridge<br>
        People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
        And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
        And mother always told me be careful of who you love<br>
        And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
        <br>
        3rd Verse<br>
        For forty days and forty nights<br>
        The law was on her side<br>
        But who can stand when she's in demand<br>
        Her schemes and plans<br>
        'Cause we danced on the floor in the round<br>
        So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice<br>
        (Do think twice)<br>
        <br>
        4th Verse<br>
        She told my baby that's a threat<br>
        As she looked at me<br>
        Then showed a photo of a baby cries<br>
        Eyes would like mine<br>
        Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby<br>
        <br>
        Bridge<br>
        People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
        And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
        She came and stood right by me<br>
        Then the smell of sweet perfume<br>
        This happened much too soon<br>
        She called me to her room<br>
        Chorus<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, she says he is my son<br>
        She says I am the one<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
