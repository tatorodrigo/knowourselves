        down the alley, searchin through the trash<br>
        you used to own a chalet, before the market crashed<br>
        now your clothes are torn and dirty, and your face is looking mean<br>
        valentino and versace, it was such an ugly scene<br>
        when you were living on the inside<br>
        the inside where you thought you had to be<br>
        but i'm living on the outside<br>
        the outside it don't bother me<br>
        <br>
        It's a terrible obsession, trying to make it to the top<br>
        a man in your profession can't afford to be a flop<br>
        gotta get yourself connected, get the mobile phone<br>
        you don't want to be rejected, you don't want to be alone<br>
        so you're living on the inside<br>
        the inside and all that money brings<br>
        but i'm living on the outside<br>
        the outside nobody pulls my strings<br>
        <br>
        It's like the inquisition at the hottest club in town<br>
        there's so much competition tryin' to do each other down<br>
        no one's saying nothing and madonna looks so cold<br>
        when you're to be natural it's the hardest pose to hold<br>
        so you're living on the inside<br>
        the inside where everybody wants to be<br>
        but i'm living on the outside<br>
        outside where the air is free<br>
        <br>
        They say the ice is melting and the earth is warming up<br>
        all the animals are dying don't know where it's gonna stop<br>
        you just look at your computer there's no need to be upset<br>
        you got virtual reality you're on the internet<br>
        and you're living on the inside<br>
        the inside where you think you gotta be<br>
        but i'm living on the outside<br>
        the outside take a walk with me<br>
        take a walk with me<br>
        <br>
        Living on the outside take a walk with me<br>
        <br>
        Living on the outside take a walk with me<br>
        <br>
        Living on the outside take a walk with me<br>
        <br>
        Living on the outside<br>
        <br>
        Living on the outside</font></div>
