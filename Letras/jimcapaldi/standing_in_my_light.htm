        alexander the great he was a big man across the land<br>
        he conquered everything in sight had the world at his command<br>
        but somewhere deep down inside<br>
        he felt there were things that he still didn't know<br>
        so he asked the wise men if they knew<br>
        or if there was some place he could go<br>
        <br>
        They said that in a far off land lived a man called diogenes<br>
        who possessed the kind of knowledge that would put his mind at ease<br>
        so alexander he saddled up<br>
        and went looking for that holy grail<br>
        he rode and rode for miles and miles<br>
        'til at last he found the trail<br>
        then stepping up he said I'm here please tell me what it is I crave<br>
        and the voice came back loud and clear<br>
        from the darkness of the cave<br>
        <br>
        And said hey you're standing in my light<br>
        hey you're standing in my light<br>
        I said hey you're standing in my light<br>
        I said hey you're standing in my light<br>
        <br>
        Well I don't know if I know what you think I know<br>
        but I think it's gonna be fine<br>
        and just remember that whatever's been written<br>
        is just the opinion of one man's mind<br>
        there are no easy answers<br>
        that I know that'll satisfy you<br>
        you just gotta take your chances<br>
        and do what you wanna do<br>
        <br>
        But you should know that in this world<br>
        you get what you deserve<br>
        so when your back's against the wall<br>
        you better not lose your nerve<br>
        so now you're standing on the street<br>
        like you got something to prove<br>
        and the pavement artist at your feet<br>
        looks up everytime you move<br>
        <br>
        And says hey you're standing in my light<br>
        says hey you're standing in my light<br>
        you know that ain't right<br>
        hey you're standing in my light<br>
        you gonna be there all night<br>
        says hey you're standing in my light<br>
        oh get out my light<br>
        <br>
        So when you're headed for the goddess centre<br>
        and the dream that lies within it<br>
        just remember what the man said<br>
        there's one born every minute<br>
        <br>
        Hey you're standing in my light<br>
        hey you're standing in my light<br>
        you know that ain't right<br>
        hey you're standing in my light<br>
        you gonna be there all night<br>
        i said hey you're standing in my light<br>
        <br>
        Hey you're standing in my light<br>
        hey you're standing in my light<br>
        you know that ain't right<br>
        hey you're standing in my light</font></div>
