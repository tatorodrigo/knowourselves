        is this thing on?<br>
        <br>
        I saw him dancing there by the record machine<br>
        I knew he must have been about seventeen<br>
        The beat was going strong, playing my favorite song<br>
        I could tell it wouldn't be long<br>
        'Til he was with me, yeah with me<br>

        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        I love rock 'n' roll<br>
        So put another dime in the jukebox, baby<br>
        I love rock 'n' roll<br>
        So come and take the time and dance with me<br>
        <br>
        He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name<br>
        &quot;But that don't matter,&quot; he said, &quot;'cause it's all the 
        same.&quot;<br>
        He said, &quot;Can I take you home where we can be alone?&quot;<br>
        And next we were movin' on<br>
        And he was with me, yeah with me<br>
        And we were movin' on and singin' the same ol' song<br>
        Yeah with me, singin'<br>
