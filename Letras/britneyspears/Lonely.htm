        think I'm so naive, how dare you play with me<br>
        I gave you heart 'n soul, yeah, tell me baby please<br>
        Why you screwin' with my head, I don't think you understand<br>
        I won't take your ***** no more, don't knock on my door<br>
        Not this time because I recognize<br>
        I've heard it all before, and I<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        I think of all the time that I wasted<br>
        Think of all the times that I took you back<br>
        Ain't no way I'll be lonely<br>
        I don't wanna let you back in<br>
        Let's just face it<br>
        Better off alone and I won't turn back<br>
        You thought that I would be lonely<br>
        I don't wanna let you back in<br>
        <br>
        Don't tell me how to feel or say that you're for real<br>
        My mind's made up I'm cool without ya, you got no more appeal<br>
        Now this girl don't need no man to say what she can do or she can't<br>
        Now I live for me and, boy, does that make you weak?<br>
        Not this time because I realize<br>
        I've heard it all before, and I...<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS - repeat<br>
        <br>
        Think of times you made me cry<br>
        You had me so confused<br>
        I'm tired of trying, leave behind this<br>
        What's a girl to do<br>
        Think of all the times you made me sick<br>
        I used to think I couldn't handle it<br>
        What you think, I'm just another chick<br>
        Mess with Brit, boy you must have tripped<br>
        What were you thinking when you lost my trust?<br>
        You had it all and now you're left with nothing<br>
        Ooh, baby now I know you want my touch<br>
        And now you're lonely and you still want me<br>
