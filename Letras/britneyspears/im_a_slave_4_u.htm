        know I may be young but I've got feelings too<br>
        And I need to do what I feel like doing<br>
        So let me go and just listen<br>
        <br>
        All you people look at me like I'm a little girl<br>
        Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world?<br>
        Always saying, &quot;Little girl, don't step into the club&quot;<br>
        Well I'm just tryin' to find out why, 'cause dancing's what I love, yeah<br>
        Get it, get it, get it, get it<br>
        Get it, get it, get it, get it<br>
        Get it, get it, get it, get it<br>
        I know I may come off quiet<br>
        I may come off shy<br>
        But I feel like talkin', feel like dancin' when I see this guy<br>
        What's practical, what's logical, what the hell, who cares<br>
        All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        I'm a slave for you<br>
        I cannot hold it, I cannot control it<br>
        I'm a slave for you<br>
        I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it<br>
        <br>
        Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me<br>
        To another time and place<br>
        Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance up on me<br>
        Leaving behind my name and age<br>
        Like that. You like that?<br>
        Yeah. Now watch me<br>
        Get it, get it, get it, get it<br>
        Get it, get it, get it, get it<br>
        Get it, get it, get it, get it<br>
        I really wanna dance tonight with you<br>
        I really wanna do what you want me to<br>
        I really wanna dance tonight with you<br>
        I really wanna do what you want me to<br>
        Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me<br>
