        sitting here alone up in my room<br>
        And thinking about the times that weve been through<br>
        (oh my love)<br>
        I'm looking at a picture in my hand<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        Trying my best to understand<br>
        I really want to know what we did wrong<br>
        With a love that felt so strong<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        If only you were here tonight<br>
        I know we can make it right<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        I dont know how to live without your love<br>
        I was born to make you happy<br>
        Cause your the only thing within my heart<br>
        I was born to make you happy<br>
        Always and forever you and me<br>
        Thats the way our life should be i dont know how to live without your 
        love<br>
        I was born to make you happy<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        I know ive been a fool since youve been gone<br>
        I'd better give it up and carry on (oh my love)<br>
        Cause living in a dream of you and me<br>
        Is not the way my life should be<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        I dont want to cry a tear for you<br>
        So forgive me if i do<br>
