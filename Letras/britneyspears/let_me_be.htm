        try to read me, you try to figure out<br>
        You try to breathe me, but you can't blow me out<br>
        You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch<br>
        I won't be falling, you won't have to pick me up<br>
        Sorry if I sound confused, and don't feel the way you do<br>

        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        Think that I might back down, but I won't<br>
        Think that I might have doubts, but I don't<br>
        No insecurities<br>
        Won't you just let me, let me be<br>
        Think that you know me now, but you don't<br>
        Think that I, I can't stand on my own<br>
        Ain't my philosophy<br>
        Won't you just let me, let me be<br>
        <br>
        Trust in my instincts, trust that I know what's right<br>
        These are the reasons that keep you up at night<br>
        Tell me go slow, this is my flow<br>
        'Cause you don't know, know what I know<br>
        Let me tell you how it feels<br>
        Baby, its time that you've seen me for real<br>
        Sorry if I sound confused and don't feel the way you do<br>
        But I won't turn around, but I won't turn around<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS - repeat<br>
        <br>
        Trust that I know, this is my show<br>
        Letting you know, gotta go the way I go<br>
        Trust that I know, this is my show<br>
