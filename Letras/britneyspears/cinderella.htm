        used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well<br>
        Oh yes, you know it's true<br>
        You called me Cinderella, all you had to do was yell<br>
        And I'd be there for you<br>
        Here I am, so try to forgive me<br>
        I don't believe in fairytales<br>
        Here we are with nothing but honesty<br>
        I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry for running away like this<br>
        And I'm sorry I've already made my wish<br>
        Aah, (but Cinderella's got to go)<br>
        <br>
        From time to time I tried to tell just what was on my mind<br>
        You told me not today<br>
        Come back, do that, where's Cinderella at<br>
        Was all you had to say<br>
        Here I am, so try to forgive me<br>
        I don't believe in fairytales<br>
        Here we are with nothing but honesty<br>
        I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay<br>

        And I'm sorry I've already made my wish<br>
        Aah, (but Cinderella's got to go)<br>
        I'm sorry, just trying to live my life<br>
        Don't worry, you're gonna be alright<br>
        But Cinderella's got to go<br>
        <br>
        I used to say I want you<br>
        You cast me in your spell<br>
        I did everything you wanted me to<br>
        But now I shall break free from all your lies<br>
        I won't be blind you see<br>
        My love, it can't be sacrificed<br>
        I won't return to thee<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sorry<br>
        I've already made up my mind<br>
        I won't return to thee<br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry to say, I'm running away now<br>
        Don't worry, you will be all right<br>
        I'm running away, I've made up my mind<br>
        You're gonna have to let me go<br>
        <br>
