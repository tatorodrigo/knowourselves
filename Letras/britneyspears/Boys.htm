        For whatever reason, I feel like I've been wanting you all my life. You 
        don't understand, I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time<br>
        It's over now<br>
        <br>
        I spotted you dancin', you made all the girls stare<br>
        Those lips and your brown eyes and the sexy hair<br>
        I said, shake my thing and make the world want you<br>
        Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do<br>
        What would it take for you to just leave with me?<br>
        Not tryin' to sound conceited but me and you were meant to be<br>
        You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl<br>
        Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one<br>
        Boys, to love her and to hold<br>
        Boys, and when a girl is with one<br>
        Boys, then she's in control<br>
        <br>
        Pulled your boy off the dance floor<br>
        Screamin' in his hear<br>
        Must of said something about me, 'cause he's looking over here<br>
        You looking at me with that sexy attitude<br>
        But the way your boy's movin' it, it puts me in the mood<br>
        What would it take for you to just leave with me?<br>
        Not tryin' to sound conceited but me and you were meant to be<br>
        You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl<br>
        Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS - repeat<br>
        <br>
        Tonight let's fly, boy have no fear<br>
        There's no time to lose<br>
        And next week, you may not see me here<br>
        So boy just make your move<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS - repeat<br>
        <br>
        Come with me, let's fly into the night<br>
        Boy, tonight is ours<br>
        Keep lovin' me, make sure you hold me tight<br>
        Let's head for the stars<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS - repeat<br>

        Can't live with 'em<br>
        Can't live without 'em</font></div>
