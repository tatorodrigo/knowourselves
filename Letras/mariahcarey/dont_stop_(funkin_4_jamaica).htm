        Woo woo, ugh hey; do the thing!<br>
        [DJ Clue] Uh Oh! uh oh!<br>
        [Mystikal] Watch yourself, get on the floor, move your feet<br>
        [DJ Clue] Woooooooeeeeeeee<br>
        <br>
        [Mystikal]<br>
        There ain't nothing you can do with the man<br>
        Except for shake your ass and clap your hands<br>
        And bob your head and move your feet<br>
        I ain't the type of rapper just to ride the beat<br>
        I set the track on fire,<br>
        I take the roof, the house and knock the air out your tires<br>
        It's the funk in here<br>
        Let Mystikal move you and Mariah sing<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Mariah Carey & Mystikal]<br>
        Don't stop baby (Shake your ass)<br>
        It's ecstasy (Watch yourself)<br>
        Turn me up a little higher<br>
        Baby light my fire<br>
        Tell me every little thing you wanna do (Do the thing)<br>
        Baby I'm into you (Get on the floor)<br>
        Don't stop baby (Shake your ass)<br>
        It's ecstasy (Oh, shake the whole building)<br>
        Turn me up a little higher (Sing it)<br>
        Baby light my fire<br>
        Tell me every little thing you want to do<br>
        I just want to love you (Uh bob your head and move your feet)<br>
        <br>
        [Mystikal]<br>
        Heads up, look out it's bout to go down<br>
        And what they didn't know about me then, I bet they know now<br>
        I'm bout to prove my fame<br>
        So just get out the way and let me do the thing<br>
        It's on tonight<br>
        I'm known to be more vulgar than the garbage truck<br>
        Sucker, you can't stop the train<br>
        You ain't got no umbrella so get your ass out the rain<br>
        You ain't louder than this<br>
        I'm like a bowl of gumbo, you ain't hotter than this<br>
        I'm what they play in the club<br>
        I keep them moving till I leave, that's what your paying me for<br>
        You already know what I do<br>
        So have my money and my munchies and my cigar too<br>
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        I'm known for bringing the heat<br>
        Ain't nobody cutting up but MC and MC<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Mariah Carey & Mystikal]<br>
        Don't stop baby (Shake your ass)<br>
        It's ecstasy (Watch yourself)<br>
        Turn me up a little higher<br>
        Baby light my fire<br>
        Tell me every little thing you wanna do (Do the thing)<br>
        Baby I'm into you(Uh oh, uh oh get on the floor)<br>
        Don't stop baby<br>
        It's ecstasy (Shake the whole building)<br>
        Turn me up a little higher<br>
        Baby light my fire (Jam)<br>
        Tell me every little thing you want to do<br>
        I just want to love you<br>
        (Li-li-li-li-li-li-ling)<br>
        <br>
        [Mystikal]<br>
        Go head and, and party<br>
        Mix that with that dark but don't waste that on my Jordans<br>
        Keep laughing till your mouth tired<br>
        Go ahead and light something up but take that cigarette outside<br>
        Get on the floor<br>
        It's another number one debut for sure<br>
        Now say it ain't real<br>
        And if I ain't a fool why you can't keep still sing<br>
        <br>
        [Mariah Carey & Mystikal]<br>
        I'm feeling<br>
        And I gotta get in the beat (For sho')<br>
        Jamaican funk that's what it was (Feel)<br>
        O-oh let it get into you (Watch yourself)<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Mariah Carey & Mystikal]<br>
        Don't stop baby (Clap your hands)<br>
        It's ecstasy (Get on the floor)<br>
        Turn me up a little higher<br>
        Baby light my fire<br>
        Tell me every little thing you wanna do (Whoa)<br>
        Baby I'm into you (It's on tonight)<br>
        Don't stop baby (Shake your ass)<br>
        It's ecstasy (Watch yourself)<br>
        Turn me up a little higher<br>
        Baby light my fire<br>
        Tell me every little thing you wanna do (Do the thing)<br>
