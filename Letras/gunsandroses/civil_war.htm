        we've got here is failure to communicate.<br>
        Some men you just can't reach...<br>
        So, you get what we had here last week,<br>
        which is the way he wants it!<br>
        Well, he gets it!<br>
        N' I don't like it any more than you men.&quot; *<br>
        <br>
        Look at your young men fighting<br>
        Look at your women crying<br>
        Look at your young men dying<br>
        The way they've always done before<br>
        <br>
        Look at the hate we're breeding<br>
        Look at the fear we're feeding<br>
        Look at the lives we're leading<br>
        The way we've always done before<br>
        <br>
        My hands are tied<br>
        The billions shift from side to side<br>
        And the wars go on with brainwashed pride<br>
        For the love of God and our human rights<br>
        And all these things are swept aside<br>
        By bloody hands time can't deny<br>
        And are washed away by your genocide<br>
        And history hides the lies of our civil wars<br>
        <br>
        D'you wear a black armband<br>
        When they shot the man<br>
        Who said &quot;Peace could last forever&quot;<br>
        And in my first memories<br>
        They shot Kennedy<br>
        I went numb when I learned to see<br>
        So I never fell for Vietnam<br>
        We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all<br>
        That you can't trust freedom<br>
        When it's not in your hands<br>
        When everybody's fightin'<br>
        For their promised land<br>
        <br>
        And<br>
        I don't need your civil war<br>
        It feeds the rich while it buries the poor<br>
        Your power hungry sellin' soldiers<br>
        In a human grocery store<br>
        Ain't that fresh<br>
        I don't need your civil war<br>
        <br>
        Look at the shoes your filling<br>
        Look at the blood we're spilling<br>
        Look at the world we're killing<br>
        The way we've always done before<br>
        Look in the doubt we've wallowed<br>
        Look at the leaders we've followed<br>
        Look at the lies we've swallowed<br>
        And I don't want to hear no more<br>
        <br>
        My hands are tied<br>
        For all I've seen has changed my mind<br>
        But still the wars go on as the years go by<br>
        With no love of God or human rights<br>
        'Cause all these dreams are swept aside<br>
        By bloody hands of the hypnotized<br>
        Who carry the cross of homicide<br>
        And history bears the scars of our civil wars<br>
        <br>
        &quot;WE PRACTICE SELECTIVE ANNIHILATION OF MAYORS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS<br>
        FOR EXAMPLE TO CREATE A VACUUM<br>
        THEN WE FILL THAT VACUUM<br>
        AS POPULAR WAR ADVANCES<br>
        PEACE IS CLOSER&quot; **<br>
        <br>
        I don't need your civil war<br>
        It feeds the rich while it buries the poor<br>
        Your power hungry sellin' soldiers<br>

        Ain't that fresh<br>

        I don't need your civil war<br>
