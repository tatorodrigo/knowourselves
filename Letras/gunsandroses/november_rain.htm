      <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
        I look into your eyes<br>
        I can see a love restrained<br>
        But darlin' when I hold you<br>
        Don't you know I feel the same<br>
        <br>
        'Cause nothin' lasts forever<br>
        And we both know hearts can change<br>
        And it's hard to hold a candle<br>
        In the cold November rain<br>
        <br>
        We've been through this auch a long long time<br>
        Just tryin' to kill the pain<br>
        <br>
        But lovers always come and lovers always go<br>
        An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today<br>
        Walking away<br>
        <br>
        If we could take the time<br>
        to lay it on the line<br>
        I could rest my head<br>
        Just knowin' that you were mine<br>
        All mine<br>
        So if you want to love me<br>
        then darlin' don't refrain<br>
        Or I'll just end up walkin'<br>
        In the cold November rain<br>
        <br>
        Do you need some time...on your own<br>
        Do you need some time...all alone<br>
        Everybody needs some time...<br>
        on their own<br>
        Don't you know you need some time...all alone<br>
        <br>
        I know it's hard to keep an open heart<br>
        When even friends seem out to harm you<br>
        But if you could heal a broken heart<br>
        Wouldn't time be out to charm you<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes I need some time...on my<br>
        own<br>
        Sometimes I need some time...all alone<br>
        Everybody needs some time...<br>
        on their own<br>
        Don't you know you need some time...all alone<br>
        <br>
        And when your fears subside<br>
        And shadows still remain<br>
        I know that you can love me<br>
        When there's no one left to blame<br>
        So never mind the darkness<br>
        We still can find a way<br>
        'Cause nothin' lasts forever<br>
        Even cold November rain<br>
        <br>
        Don't ya think that you need somebody<br>
        Don't ya think that you need someone<br>
        Everybody needs somebody<br>
        You're not the only one<br>
        You're not the only one</font></div>
