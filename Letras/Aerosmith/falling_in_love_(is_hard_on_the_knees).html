        so bad you're so bad...<br>
        <br>
        You think you're in love, Like it's a real<br>
        sure thing. But every time you fall<br>
        You get your ass in a sling. You used to be<br>
        strong, but now it's ooh baby please<br>
        'Cause fallin' in love is hard on the knees<br>
        <br>
        You're so bad you're so bad...<br>
        <br>
        We was making love when you told me that you loved me<br>
        I thought ol' cupid he was taking aim<br>
        I was believer when you told me that you loved me<br>
        And then you called me someone else's name<br>
        <br>
        There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please<br>
        You know what I want, And it ain't one of these.<br>
        You're bad to the bone, And your girlfriend agrees<br>
        That falling in love is so hard on the knees<br>
        <br>
        You're so bad you're so bad...<br>
        <br>
        Chip off the old block<br>
        Man you're so much like your sister<br>
        My fantasize it must be out of luck<br>
        My old libido has been blowing a transistor<br>
        I feel like I have been hit by a fuck<br>
        <br>
        Yeah<br>
        <br>
        I'm Jones'in on love, Yeah I got the DT's<br>
        You say that we will<br>
        But there ain't no guarantees<br>
        <br>
        I'm major in love, But in all minor keys<br>
        'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees<br>
        <br>
        What are you looking for<br>
        It's got to be hard core<br>
        Must be some kind of nouveau riche<br>
        <br>
        Is this your only chance<br>
        Or some hypnotic trance<br>
        Let's get you on a tighter leash<br>
        Own it own it own it<br>
        You're so bad you're so bad<br>
        You ain't the good<br>
        Is what you said down to the letter<br>
        But you like the way I hold the microphone<br>
        Sometimes I'm good but when I'm bad<br>
        I'm even better. Don't give me no lip<br>
        I've got enough of my own<br>
        There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please<br>
        You know what I want and it ain't one of these.<br>
        You're bad to the bone, And your girlfriend agrees<br>
