        remember the rain on the roof that morning<br>
        And all the things that I wanted to say<br>
        The angry words that came from nowhere without warning<br>
        That stole the moment and sent me away<br>
        And you standing there at the doorway crying<br>
        And me wondering if I'd ever be back<br>
        <br>
        I said I didn't come here to leave you<br>
        I didn't come here to lose<br>
        I didn't come here believing I would ever be away from you<br>
        I didn't come here to find out<br>
        There's a weakness in my faith<br>
        I was brought here by the power of love<br>
        Love by grace<br>
        <br>
        And I remember the road just went on forever<br>
        Just couldn't seem to turn that car around<br>
        'Till in the distance like a long lost treasure<br>
        A phone booth that just could not be found<br>
        And you standing there at the doorway waiting<br>
        And the moment when we laid back down<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        That was just a moment in time<br>
        And one we'll never forget<br>
        One we can leave behind<br>
        'Cause when there was doubt<br>
        You'll remember I said<br>
        <br>
        I didn't come here believing I would ever be away form you<br>
        I didn't come here to find out<br>
        There's a weakness in my faith<br>
        I was brought here by the power of love<br>
        I was brought here by the power of love<br>
        Love by grace</font></div>
