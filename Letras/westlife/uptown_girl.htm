          girl<br>
          She's been living in her uptown world<br>
          I bet she never had a back street guy<br>
          I bet her mama never told her why<br>
          <br>
          I'm gonna try for an uptown girl<br>
          She's been living in her white bread world<br>
          As long as anyone with hot blood can<br>
          And now she's looking for a downtown man<br>
          That's what I am<br>
          <br>
          And when she knows what<br>
          She wants from her time<br>
          And when she wakes up<br>
          And makes up her mind<br>
          <br>
          She'll see I'm not so tough<br>
          Just because<br>
          I'm in love with an uptown girl<br>
          You know I've seen her in her uptown world<br>
          She's getting tired of her high class toys<br>
          And all her presents from her uptown boys<br>
          She's got a choice<br>
          <br>
          Uptown girl<br>
          You know I can't afford to buy her pearls<br>
          But maybe someday when my ship comes in<br>
          She'll understand what kind of guy I've been<br>
          And then I'll win<br>
          <br>
          And when she's walking<br>
          She's looking so fine<br>
          And when she's talking<br>
          She'll say that she's mine<br>
          <br>
          She'll say I'm not so tough<br>
          Just because<br>
          I'm in love<br>
          With and uptown girl<br>
