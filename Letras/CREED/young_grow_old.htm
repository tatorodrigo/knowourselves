        said he's falling to pieces<br>
        Fighting the boy and the man<br>
        Over his shoulder there was freedom<br>
        But consciousness has tied his hands<br>
        Embodied youth was his distinction<br>
        Now inhibition's in demand<br>
        So driven by his fear of weakness<br>
        That's his key to understand<br>
        So far in a distant land<br>
        There's a fight between boy and man<br>
        See the light through the open door<br>
        Sit and watch as the young grow old<br>
        Trading places in the circle<br>
        Turn the glass, spill the sand<br>
        They say that time can make the difference<br>
        But age doesn't make you a man<br>
        So far in a distant land<br>
        There's a fight between boy and man<br>
        See the light through the open door<br>
        Sit and watch as the young grow old<br>
        So young but overblown<br>
        So young but overblown<br>
        So young but overblown<br>
        Take a look now, see the boy is weakened<br>
        Watch him fade, watch him fade away<br>
        Take a bow and the boy is defeated<br>
        Is this the way, this the way?<br>
        So far in a distant land<br>
        There's a fight between boy and man<br>
        See the light through the open door<br>
        Sit and watch as the young grow old</font></div>
