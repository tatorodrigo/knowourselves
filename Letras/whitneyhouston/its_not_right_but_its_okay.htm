          night you and your boys went out to eat<br>
          Then they hung out<br>
          But you came home around three<br>
          If six of y'all went out<br>
          Then four of you were really cheap<br>
          Cause only two of you had dinner<br>
          I found your credit card receipt<br>
          <br>
          Chorus 1<br>
          It's not right<br>
          But it's okay<br>
          I'm gonna make it anyway<br>
          Pack your bags up and leave<br>
          Don't you dare come running back to me<br>
          It's not right<br>
          But it's okay<br>
          I'm gonna make it anyway<br>
          Close the door behind you<br>
          Leave your key<br>
          I'd rather be alone<br>
          Than unhappy<br>
          <br>
          I'll pack your bags<br>
          So you can leave town for a week<br>
          The phone rings<br>
          And then you look at me<br>
          You said it was one of your friends<br>
          Down on 54th St.<br>
          So why did 213<br>
          Show up on your Caller I.D.<br>
          <br>
          Chorus 2<br>
          I've been through all of this before<br>
          So how could you think<br>
          That I would stand around<br>
          And take some more<br>
          Things are gonna change<br>
          That's why you have to leave<br>
          So don't turn around to see my face<br>
          There's no more fears and tears<br>
          For you to see<br>
          <br>
          Was it really worth you going out like that<br>
          See I'm moving on<br>
          And I refuse to turn back<br>
          See all of this time<br>
          I thought I had somebody down for me<br>
          It turns out<br>
          You were making a fool of mee<br>
          <br>
