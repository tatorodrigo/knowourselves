        Here's a little bit of old school for ya,<br>
        That goes a little something like this...<br>
        <br>
        I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block<br>
        The popular one with the rising stocks<br>
        So that's when I had this bright idea<br>
        Throw the party of the month<br>
        No, the party of the year<br>
        <br>
        All the fine girls couldn't turn it down<br>
        Now all I gotta do is get my parents out<br>
        Should I send them to a movie<br>
        No, send them to a show<br>
        Let me think, hmmmmmm<br>
        It's gotta be long though<br>
        <br>
        I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin home<br>
        It's a Friday night have you seen Aunt Jo<br>
        And don't worry about stayin' out too long<br>
        Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone<br>
        <br>
        Have a good time...<br>
        <br>
        The door bell rings cuz the party's here<br>
        I'm crankin up the stereo like it's New Years<br>
        Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man<br>
        (Everybody do it like Aaron can)<br>
        <br>
        First on the floor, you know that's me<br>
        Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV<br>
        I'm guessin' where I'm goin' cuz I lost my head<br>
        Then I jumped on table, this is what I said<br>
        <br>
        People all around you gotta<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        Everyone together sing it loud<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        Jump all around come on<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        What...<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        Say it again<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        <br>
        People all around you gotta<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        From the left to the right, make noise<br>
        (Come get it)<br>
        Here we go now, come on<br>
        Uh uh what what<br>
        <br>
        Na na na na... Na na na na...<br>
        <br>
        Things are goin' great<br>
        Then to my surprise<br>
        Some people walked in, I didn't recognize<br>
        I said fellows yo ya gotta get out<br>
        <br>
        (Hey man I heard this was an open house)<br>
        Open house?<br>
        (Yeah that's what the flyers said)<br>
        I didn't put out flyers!<br>
        (Well somebody did)<br>
        <br>
        Lynn walked in<br>
        The girl I'm crushin'<br>
        And the kid spilled juice<br>
        On my Mom's new cushion<br>
        <br>
        I turned around and<br>
        Another kid broke the lamp<br>
        (I hope they weren't expensive)<br>
        They got them from France<br>
        For now I won't sweat it<br>
        I'll clean it up later<br>
        There's a honey over there<br>
        And I really wanna meet her<br>
        <br>
        People all around you gotta<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        Everyone together sing it loud<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        Jump all around come on<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        What?<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        Say it again here we go, uh<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        <br>
        People all around you gotta<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        From the left to the right, make noise<br>
        (come get it)<br>
        Here we go now, come on<br>
        Uh uh what what<br>
        <br>
        Aaron C's in the house, here we go<br>
        Come with it<br>
        <br>
        Break it down<br>
        (go go go go go...)<br>
        <br>
        Is that a car door<br>
        Oh dang I'm in trouble<br>
        Everybody get out now<br>
        On the double<br>
        I'm dead (your done) that's it for me<br>
        I'm gonna be picked off my family tree<br>
        <br>
        Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had<br>
        I don't wanna even start thinkin' about dad<br>
        I'm hustlin around the house<br>
        Trying to clean up the mess<br>
        I sure put my new white Nikes to the test<br>
        <br>
        The car door slammed<br>
        And they're walking up the steps<br>
        I guess life is good with 10 seconds left<br>
        (AARON!!!???!!!)<br>
        <br>
        Grounded<br>
        <br>
        Chorus<br>
        <br>
        Aaron C's in the house, come on <br>
        (come get it)<br>
        Uh uh what what<br>
        <br>
