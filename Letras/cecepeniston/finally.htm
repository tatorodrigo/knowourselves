        Finally it has happened to me<br>
        Right in front of my face<br>
        My feelin's can't describe it<br>
        Finally it has happened to me<br>
        Right in front of my face<br>
        And I just cannot hide it<br>
        <br>
        Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams<br>
        The one and only true love or at least it seems<br>
        With brown coco skin and curly black hair<br>
        It's just the way he looks at me, that gentle lovin' stare<br>
        <br>
        Finally you come along<br>
        The way I feel about you it just can't be wrong<br>
        If you only knew the way I feel about you<br>
        I just can't describe him oh no no<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        It seemed so many times he seemed to be the one<br>
        But all he ever wanted was to have a little fun<br>
        But now you've come along and brightened up my world<br>
        In my heart I feel it I'm that special kind of girl<br>
        <br>
        Finally you come along<br>
        The way I feel about you it just can't be wrong<br>
        If you only knew the way I feel about you<br>
        I just can't describe him oh no no<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS<br>
        CHORUS<br>
        <br>
        Finally<br>
        Ooooooooh finally yeah yeah<br>
        Oh<br>
        <br>
        RAP: True love, a feelin' I never knew<br>
        Until you came into my life and now it's real<br>
        I never knew that I would find the time<br>
        Before you I thought love was blind<br>
        <br>
        And my life was coastin' out my emotion<br>
        Too strong for words, you're set for devotion<br>
        A-pushin' me from mutual attraction<br>
        True love, the chemical reaction<br>
        <br>
        Then my actions<br>
        Reflect those of a way to makin' this a better love<br>
        A never ending plan like man and wife<br>
        Flavourful to my life like a spice<br>
        <br>
        Summon me to death, you're my big mean of protection<br>
        My one and only source of affection<br>
        So I'm puttin' all games behind me<br>
        I've been lookin' for the key to love and I've found it finally<br>
