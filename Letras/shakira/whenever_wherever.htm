          you were born that far away so<br>
          We could both make fun of distance<br>
          Lucky that I love a foreign land for<br>
          The lucky fact of your existence<br>
          Baby I would climb the Andes solely<br>
          To count the freckles on your body<br>
          Never could imagine there were only<br>
          Too many ways to love somebody<br>
          <br>
          Lo ro lo le lo le<br>
          Lo ro lo le lo le<br>
          Can't you see...I'm at your feet<br>
          <br>
          Whenever, wherever<br>
          We'll learn to be together<br>
          I'll be there and you'll be near<br>
          And that's the deal my dear<br>
          They're over, you're under<br>
          You'll never have to wonder<br>
          We can always play by ear<br>
          But that's the deal my dear<br>
          <br>
          Lucky that my lips not only mumble<br>
          They spill kisses like a fountain<br>
          Lucky that my breasts are small and humble<br>
          So you don't confuse them with mountains<br>
          Lucky I have strong legs like my mother<br>
          To run for cover when I need it<br>
          And these two eyes are for no other<br>
          The day you leave we'll cry a river<br>
          <br>

          At your feet...I'm at your feet<br>
          <br>
          Whenever, Wherever<br>
          We're meant to be together<br>
          I'll be there and you'll be near<br>
          And that's the deal my dear<br>
          They're over, you're under<br>
          You'll never have to wonder (???)<br>
          We can always play by ear<br>
          But that's the deal my dear<br>

          <br>
          Tell me one more time<br>
          That you'll live<br>
          Lost in my eyes<br>
          <br>
          Whenever, wherever<br>
